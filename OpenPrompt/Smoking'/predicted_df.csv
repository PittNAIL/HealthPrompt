###-##-##
admission date :
##/##/####
discharge date :
history of present illness :
this is a ## year old patient initially admitted to dr. riode area status post an aorto bifemoral bypass in ##/## with an end to end proximal and to the common femoral bilaterally .
the patient has had recurrent claudication for the last five months and has developed lesions on the first toe which is apparently similar to aparonychia .
he had an angiogram which shows a severe stenosis in the right distal area with a thrombosing right limb of an aorto femoral graft .
he also has an irregular lesion at the profunda femoris origin and with the superficial femoral occluded bilaterally .
he was therefore admitted to the hospital for an ileofemoral bypass .
the patient unfortunately continues to smoke and has greater than a ## pack year history of smoking and by notes of dr. area 's office , this has been discussed at length with him and the implications of the smoking .
he has a history of a deep vein thrombosis and a question of a pulmonary embolism with what is thought to be a non fully documented hypercoagulable state .
he had a left superficial femoral artery interposition graft around #### which is non functioning at the present time , most of which was done at the alconspore woocawo medical center .
allergies :
the patient has no known drug allergies .
medications on admission :
his medications on admission include coumadin and levofloxacin .
his coumadin has been held for two days .
his claudication is equal bilaterally .
physical examination :
on physical examination was remarkable for no carotid bruits , a ventral hernia without any masses which was reasonably reducible .
his rectal exam was refused at the time of surgery since apparently it was negative at the tocon hospital the previous week .
he has a first and fourth toe which had some purulent discharge around the toes with ischemic modeled toes and on the left side there were no lesions in the feet .
his pulse exam was a femoral pulse bilaterally , but none distally .
laboratory data :
his bun and creatinine were within normal limits at ## and 1.3 and his hematocrit was ## with a white blood count of ##,### and ###,### platelet count .
he has ankle brachial indices of .## bilaterally but with his right toes appearing ischemic with lesions he would most likely not heal these lesions .
hospital course :
dr. area had asked me to see the patient and after discussing with the patient it was agreed that i would proceed with revascularization of his right leg since he had a angiogram which demonstrated a failing limb of his aortofemoral graft and a tight profundus stenosis .
after discussing with the patient , getting his prothrombin time closer to range , he was brought to the operating room where a ileo profunda bypass was performed with an 8 mm .
ep to fe under general endotracheal anesthesia .
there was copious thrombus in the distal right limb of the aortofemoral graft which also had a thromboendarterectomy performed and excellent inflow was achieved .
superficial femoral artery was divided since it was also chronically occluded .
there was a significant amount of thrombus at the anastomosis as well which had developed a small aneurysmaltype of dilatation , although there was no dehiscence of the anastomosis .
the profunda had been opened beyond the origin stenosis and the bypass was then performed providing and excellent flow to the calf and excellent pulsevolume recordings were obtained with strong upstrokes .
it was therefore elected not to proceed with a distal bypass graft to the popliteal arteries which would have been required should this not have worked .
the patient postoperatively did quite well .
he had continued good post volume recordings and there was no question that with this improved circulation and silvadene dressings to his toes that they actually started to heal in his postoperative course with improved perfusion and capillary refill .
his groin incision was healing nicely and he was on heparin , being converted to coumadin .
because of the issue relating to his hypercoagulable state , and the need for getting him in range , he was keptin the hospital and not discharged .
the orders of his wounds and wound care were clarified and he was transferred to frontera ## to ensure that this would be performed properly .
no cellulitis was present , and the patient had indicated his desire to be discharged .
despite loading him on coumadin , his prothrombin time and inr increased slowly and he left the hospital without discharge order or discharge planning on the ##th of december .
i had called the patient and discussed with him his care , which he had been then transferring to his local medical doctor for anticoagulation purposes .
i explained to the patient that because of his early discharge i would not be able to be responsible for his care but would be happy to see him in theoffice for removal of his sutures and an appointment for that was undertaken .

non-q wave myocardial infarction .
unsigned
dis
report status :
unsigned
admission date :
##-##-##
discharge date :
##-2-##
principal diagnosis :
non-q wave myocardial infarction .
associated diagnosis :
status post anterior myocardial infarction in ##-## , status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left anterior descending in ##-## , hypertension , diabetes mellitus .
principal procedure :
coronary angiography , exercise tolerance test with thallium .
medications on discharge :
metoprolol ## mg po bid , isordil ## mg po tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 po qd .
history of present illness :
the patient is a ## year old portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i may #### and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the lad who presented on ##-##-## with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
he had no prior cardiac history until may #### when on 5-## he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .
he was found at that time to have 3-4 mm st segment elevations in v1 through v4 at pre health .
the patient was transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital and had 4-7 mm st segment elevations across the precordium with q's in v1 and v2 , 2 mm st elevation in avl , and 1-2 mm reciprocal st depression in ii , iii , and f.
on physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .
the cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of ##/## , rv ##/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of ## .
he had a ##% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was ptca 'd to a residual of ##% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .
he also had some mild to moderate disease at the om1 noted at that time .
the patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit where he had a peak cpk of 5,### and ##.7% mb's .
his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .
he had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .
on day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of ##% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .
on day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in ii , iii , and avf , and 1.5 mm downsloping st depressions in v5 and v6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on thallium .
therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal pda lesion and a circumflex lesion after the om .
the patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with dr. shuffburle of gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with dr. amesin of cardiology and dr. shuffpasc of dingclearf alllirefaith memorial hospital .
however , he did not keep any of these appointments .
he went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .
on the a.m. of ##-##-## , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
he came to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital emergency ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .
he was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .
cardiac risk factors :
his cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .
past medical history :
his past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled .
past surgical history :
his past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .
medications on admission :
on admission , he was on isordil ## tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .
habits :
the patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .
physical examination :
the physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of ###/## , a heart rate of ## , respirations of ## , temperature of ## .
the heent exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact .
the pupils equal , round , reactive to light .
the oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .
there were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .
the neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .
the carotids were 1+ without bruits .
the heart was regular rate and rhythm , s4 , s1 , s2 , with a i / vi systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
the lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .
the abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .
the liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .
there was no splenomegaly .
the femoral pulses were diminished .
he had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .
the extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
the pulses were 1+ bilaterally .
the skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .
the rectal examination was guaiac negative .
laboratory data :
the laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , bun and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first cpk of ### , and a hematocrit of ##.1 .
the portable chest x-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .
the electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at ## , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor r-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped t-waves in v1 through v5 , which were of no significant change since his last ekg on 5-##-## .
hospital course :
the patient was admitted to the step down unit for a rule out mi protocol .
he was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .
no beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only ###/## .
the patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak cpk of ### and ##.9% mb fraction .
this was a non-q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
on ##-##-## , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been ptca 'd , a lesion in the first om , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the om3 .
the left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .
given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the ptca , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .
he was ambulated progressively on the floor .
a beta blocker was started with metoprolol initially at ## mg po bid and eventually increased to ## mg po bid .
the patient ambulated extensively on the fih ## floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .
on ##-2-## , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with thallium imaging .
this treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .
the patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .
there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm st depression in ii , iii , and avf .
the study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .
thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .
there was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .
these images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous thallium images in may #### .
after extensive discussion between myself , dr. amesin , and dr. scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .
the patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .
dr. amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance .
previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .
the importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .
she will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with dr. amesin as well as dr. lfsquarc on the outside .
the patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .
despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .
he will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .

the chest x-ray showed a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm .
hospital course :
the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of ##/8 , pulmonary artery pressure ##/## , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ## .
he had a proximal ##% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal .
the left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a ##% residual stenosis .
an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically .
the patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the micu .
on hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned .
the patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra-aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with serax .
the lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well .
on the third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed .
the intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off .
after removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated .
on the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor .
however , after a single dose of ## mg of po metoprolol , the patient 's blood pressure dropped to the ##/## range and he was therefore kept in the micu .
the peak cpk level was on the second hospital day and was 5,### with ##.7% mb fraction .
on the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor .
once on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain .
an echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of ##% .
on transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool .

he did not have chest pain .
there were st and t wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery .
the thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution .
based on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel .
these findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin .
because of his persistently marginal blood pressure at ###/## , an ace inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued .
the patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day .

this is a ## year old lady , chronic smoker is admitted with increasing shortness of breath of six hours duration .
the patient recently went to lafullland le and on a flight back to ty in hercent avenue , hisflintpa a , the patient developed increased breathlessness , wanting the airplane to make an emergency landing at ton-balt airport so that she could get medical assistance .
the patient mentions that she had been having a breathing problem for the last two years , which had gradually progressed .
the patient had not seen a physician at this time and was not on any medications .
the patient personally felt that this was secondary to anxiety , however , during the holiday she had a hectic touring schedule and she felt her shortness of breath was getting gradually worse .
three days prior to the flight back to maine , the patient said that she developed a cold with progressive productive cough which got worse in the last three to four days prior to admission .
the patient was not on any medication for the journey and there was no accompanying fever or hemoptysis .
the patient felt excessively dyspneic on the day of her travel , such that she could not walk to the airport and was given a wheelchair with assistance .
on the six hour flight , the patient suddenly felt worsening of her shortness of breath and got up and vomited .
she was also incontinent .
an anesthesiologist on board saw her and felt that she was significantly hypotensive and had the plane land emergently at nebraska .
she was subsequently transferred to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital .
in the emergency room the patient was given nebulizers .
she was placed on i.v. heparin and given oxygen three liters with sats remaining somewhere between ## and ##% .
she was also started on zithromax .

chest x-ray :
subtle increased density in the left middle lung .
electrocardiogram notable for sinus tachycardia with emphysematous pattern , poor r progression v1 through v3 , and p. pulmonale with right axis deviation .
hospital course :
the patient was admitted for acute and chronic respiratory distress with likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and question of a pulmonary embolus .
the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial ck 's which were normal .
echocardiogram was obtained which showed normal left ventricle , a dilated right ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis .
the rvsp was estimated at ## .
echocardiogram findings with persistent , profound right heart failure .
the patient subsequently underwent a pulmonary arteriogram which revealed no pulmonary emboli , but pulmonary artery pressure of ##/## , wedge pressure of ## and a right atrial pressure of ## .
the patient also had mild liver function test abnormalities , for which she underwent right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed patent portal vein , patent hepatic vein and artery and bilateral small pleural effusions with a 4 cm. complex cystic lesion with calcified walls on the lateral aspect of the spleen .
the patient 's heparin was subsequently discontinued .
pulmonary status stabilized , with the patient 's room air sat hovering around ##% .
microbiologic work up for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare exacerbation was subsequently negative .
the patient remained cardiovascularly stable but unclear etiology of her subtle electrocardiogram changes and respiratory distress .
it was subsequently felt after full work up with a negative pa gram , plus / minus vq , negative echocardiogram , negative sero-ck 's and no evolving electrocardiogram that the patient had pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic lung disease .
it was felt that the patient likely had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of greater severity and duration than initially suspected and by history from the patient , in particular supported by her chronic co2 retention on subsequent arterial blood gases .
the patient was maintained on treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation , including steroid taper and nebs as well as antibiotic coverage .
repeat chest x-ray subsequently showed hyperinflation consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , no signs of pneumonia or pulmonary edema , bilateral blunting of the costophrenic angles , consistent with pleural thickening , and / or small bilateral pleural effusions , consistent with right upper quadrant ultrasound .
pulmonary service was consulted .

history and reason for hospitalization :
granrivern call is a ##-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home .
his family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with parkinson 's disease or features consistent with parkinsonism .
this was poorly responsive to eldopa .
he was later seen by dr. flo cuchkote at the ph university of medical center and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .
over the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .
he also developed a urinary incontinence .
he had had two falls to his wife 's recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .
on the morning of admission at 8 of the clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking "" gibberish "" .
he was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately ##:## a.m.
there was no definite clonic activity .
there was no known incontinence .
he was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the ph university of medical center emergency room where he was orally intubated .
a trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the neurology service .
medications on admission :
coumadin 4 mgs po qhs , vasotec 5 mgs po qd , lasix prn , digoxin 0.## mgs poqd , proscar and sinemet .
allergies :
no known drug allergies .
past medical history :
1) atrial fibrillation on coumadin ,
2) deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus ; the wife states since he was in the infantry in world war ii .
3) question progressive supranuclear palsy .
4) old right frontal infarct .
5) hypertension .
social history :
he lives with his wife who is his primary care giver .
he is a former professor at montana .
tobacco ; he has some distant history of some very minimal use .
alcohol ; he has no recent use .
he was a previous drinker of one "" old fashioned "" every night .
family history :
he has a father who had dementia .
there was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family .
physical examination :
vital signs in the emergency room were ###/### for blood pressure , heart rate ## and irregular .
he was afebrile .
in general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face .
head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated .
his neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits .
oropharynx was intubated with blood as well .
lungs ; clear to auscultation bilaterally .
cardiovascular examination ; regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
abdominal examination ; soft , non-tender , non-distended , normal active bowel sounds .
extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .
neurologically ; he opens his eyes to voice .
he does not regard the examiner .
he had no blink to threat .
his pupils were three down to two on the right and five down to four on the left .
according to the family this iansicoria was old .
he had intact corneals bilaterally and intact horizontal dull movements bilaterally .
he had left greater than right nasal stimulation to grimace .
he had no gag to tube manipulation .
motor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands .
he triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to pain .
his deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right brachial radialis and right patella ; everywhere else his reflexes were 1 .
his toes were down going .
summary of laboratory and radiological examinations :
sodium ### , potassium 3.5 , chloride ### , bicarbonates ##.8 , bun ## , creatinine 1.1 , glucose ### , po2 ### , pco2 ## , ph 7.## , asomus ### , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count ##.1 , hematocrit ##.6 , platelet count ### , prothrombin time ##.2 , inr 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time ##.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .
chest x-ray clear .
electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of st depressions in v4-6 .
head ct scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .
there was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction .
hospital course and treatment :
1) neurology :
the patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .
he had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the intensive care unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .
it did , however , show diffuse slowing .
he was given 1.5 grams of dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .
his hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the intensive care unit .
he continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .
he did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .
his diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .
it was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .
it was not felt likely to be due to parkinson 's disease , as he had no significant response to eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .
he had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on october ## , #### .
this showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .
in addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .
however , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .
the etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .
2) cardiovascular :
his electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .
he was on intravenous tng and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .
he did have a slight elevation of his tpk with an additional value of ### with a mb fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .
that was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent ckmbs and was felt that he had a very small "" leaflet "" .
he remained chest pain free throughout his admission .
3) pulmonary :
after his initial intubation he remained quite stable .
he was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .
however , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .
4) hematology :
he had his prothrombin time reversed with vitamin k 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .
his anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .
it was decided that his goal inr was to be 2.0 .
he did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge inr was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .
it was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .
5) gastrointestinal :
he was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the ph university of medical center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .
thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on october ## , #### and he tolerated feeding quite well .
in discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .
however , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .
the family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .
disposition / plan on discharge :
stable .
doctor 's discharge orders :
the patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary .
the patient is to follow up with dr. ria in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .

5. bronchitis
6. cervical polyps
chief complaint :
the patient is a ## year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest ##/##/## .
she was transferred to retelk county medical center for further therapy , and transplant evaluation .
patient also received aicd .
history of present illness :
the patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .
patient 's past medical history is to besummarized as follows :
in #### the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in hispit , delaware .
since that time the patient has been treated medically .
in ##/## the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a mbo2 of ##.7 mg per kilogram .
on ##/## the patient underwent transplant evaluation at retelk county medical center .
echocardiogram showed severe pr and mitral regurgitation , mild ai and ejection fraction of ##% to ##% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .
consequently the patient was started on coumadin .
catheterization at that time showed an ra pressure of ## , cardiac index of 1.7 , svr of #### and a pvr of ### .
coronaries were completely normal .
consequently the patient was admitted to the ccu for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction .
in the ccu the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to captopril and isordil .
hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a svr of #### and a wedge of ## .
pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with fev1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased elcl of ##% .
repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .
furthermore , due to the patient 's long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .
consequently the patient was discharged on captopril , digoxin , lasix , micronase , isordil and prn inhalers .
the patient did well at home until 1/##/## when she was admitted to souland in nixmont bovo with increasing congestive heart failure .
at that time the patient was aggressively diuresed .
by report , in the interim since discharge from retelk county medical center , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .
dring this hospitalization at hahkellrick hospital , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest .
she was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block .
she was treated for a short time with lidocaine and eventually weaned off .
she was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to retelk county medical center for further evaluation .
the patient was transferred to retelk county medical center on ##/##/## , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .
the patient was evaluated by the chf and heart transplant service .
it was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .
furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the alllo eino hospital which recommended eps to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient 's arrhythmia with possible aicd placement if the eps was negative .
note , per recommendation from the chf team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first ## hours of the patient 's hospitalization without difficulty .
on ##/##/## an eps study was performed .
the patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation .
consequently aicd placement was recommended .
consequently , the patient underwent aicd placement on ##/##/## .
note , from ##/## to ##/## there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis .
consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the aicd .
note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .
cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement .
thus , aicd placement was performed on ##/##/## following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .
there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the aicd placement .
by ##/##/## the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the aicd placement site .
at this point it was felt the patient would go home on ##/##/## .
it was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to vonamemp , la via plane by herself .
this was discussed with both the patient and the cardiology b team .

abdominal aortic aneurysm was discovered on examination and patient was referred to retelk county medical center .
he was admitted on ##/##/## and echocardiogram done on ##/##/## revealed poor left ventricular function and cardiac catheterization was done on admission which showed three vessel disease .
patient was referred to cardiology and underwent a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft on ##/##/## .
his post-operative course was complicated by an e. coli urinary tract infection and transient acute renal failure with increasing creatinine .
patient 's renal function returned to normal over several days , however .
the patient 's last ultrasound of his aorta revealed a l0 cm aneurysm and he presented at the time of admission for an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .

hospital course :
the patient was admitted and placed in isolation on neutropenic precautions .
he was transfused with 1/2 units of packed red blood cells and given lasix periodically to prevent him from going into congestive heart failure has he had on his prior transfusion .
because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated leuco four units .
the patient had a good bump in his hematocrit , more than expected from ## to high ## 's range next day after 3 1/2 units , but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1/2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells .
he again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high ## 's after a total of 4 units , so he was given 2 more total units in 1/2 units segments the following day .
his hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than ## and was discharged with hematocrit of ## on ##-7-## .

he has no peripheral edema .
his neurological exam is nonfocal .
laboratory data :
sodium ### , potassium 4.4 , chloride ### , co2 ## , calcium 9.3 , phosphorous 1.2 , bun 9 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose ### .
uric acid 8.4 , bilirubin 0.7 , alkaline phosphatase ## , amylase ## , sgot ## , and his digoxin level was 1.0 .
hematocrit ##% , white blood cell count #### , mcv ## , pt and ptt were normal .
urinalysis was unremarkable .
his chest x-ray was normal with bilateral pleural thickening .
his electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation .
there were nonspecific st and t wave changes .
hospital course :
the patient was admitted to hellworthston hospital .
there , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by cardiology and anesthesiology .
there was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed .
on june ## , #### , dr. lenni breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery .
he placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with ### cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with ### cc. per minute flow .
he weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass .
he had no hemodynamic difficulties .
he was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout .
he did revert back to atrial fibrillation .
he was extubated within forty eight hours .
he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit on june ## .
he reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required digoxin , and verapamil to control .
he could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of quinaglute .
he also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the nutrition service .
he was advised to have an ideal body weight of ### pounds , and clearly a #### calorie diet was appropriate for him .
weight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease .
he was treated with digoxin and diuretics along with ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function .
he was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation .
it was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis .
primary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction .
he will be followed closely in ## hwy , hamp by dr. laymie aslinke .

history of present illness :
breunlinke is a ##-year-old patient of dr. brendniungand asilbekote in california .
she is referred for progressive angina .
she had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing .
she has used antibiotic prophylaxis since #### .
in #### she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by dr. elks at feargunwake otacaa community hospital and did well until #### when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded .
in october , #### , dr. no re-did her bypass operation .
she had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 .
in #### she had a ddd pacemaker for complete heart block .
she had exertional angina at that time .
in november , #### she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to ona hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft .
she had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis .
since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin .
she was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here .
in may , #### she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to ### and her blood pressure fell to ## systolic .
she had diffuse ischemic st segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect .
she has had no syncope .
her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol .
she has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction .
she is a remote cigarette smoker .
she also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages .
she has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .
social history :
she is a widow for ## years and retired ## years from palmci
she lives alone .
her son , nertland is nearby and he works at the em nysonken medical center on verville .
they live in ohio .
physical examination :
she is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot ### pounds .
her blood pressure was ###/## , pulse ## and regular .
neck veins are not distended .
respiratory rate ## .
carotids :
no bruits .
lungs were clear .
cardiac :
1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
abdomen was benign .
peripheral pulses intact .
neurological examination non-focal .
laboratory data :
on admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows ddd pacing .
hematocrit ## percent , white blood cell count #### , pt and ptt normal .
sodium ### , potassium 4.2 , chloride ### , carbon dioxide ## , bun ## , creatinine 1.0 .
hospital course and treatment :
the patient was admitted to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .
there , her pulmonary wedge pressure was ## and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure ##/## .
her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .
she had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .
her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .
the saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .
the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .
the saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .
this was considered her culprit lesion .
this was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .
in addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .
her left internal mammary artery was also unused .
it was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .
she would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .
this was intermittent .
the p wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .
the patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .
it was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .
her pacemaker was set to a vvi mode which sensed appropriately .
she was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .
when her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .
carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .
the situation was reviewed with dr. niste graft .
he felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .
for this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .
the situation was reviewed with dr. no of the pacemaker service .
on august ## , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a cpi unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .## mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .
there was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .
it just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .
she tolerated this well .
her medications were resumed .
she ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by dr. brendniungand asilbekote in bi masase , ks .

subsequent mammography was , reportedly , benign and without significant interval change .
however , by may #### , she had appreciated a fullness in the right breast , and noted the emergence of a mass , which increased in size over time .
mammography was repeated , which was highly suspicious for malignancy .
an ultrasound of the lesion was similarly suspicious for neoplasm .
the patient , therefore , went to incisional biopsy , which confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma .

ralda room titchekoopelks md
the patient is a ##-year-old male with a long standing history of peripheral vascular disease and tobacco use who has had multiple vascular procedures in the past including a fem-fem bypass , a left fem pop once above the knee with ptfe graph and then again below the knee with a refreshed saphenous vein graft as well as bilateral tmas and a right fem pop bypass who presents with a nonhealing wound of his left tma stump as well as a pretibial ulcer that is down to the bone .
the patient was admitted to obtain adequate pain control and to have any mri / mra to evaluate any possible bypass procedures that could be performed .
the patient 's coumadin was held and he was started on heparin drip in order to rapidly reverse him on time for an operation .
he remained in the hospital for the first two days and was unable to receive his mri until hospital day # 4 at which time , the mri and mra showed no possible areas for a bypass graft and it was assessed that an above-knee amputation would be the proper operation to perform .
he was brought down to the operating room on ##/##/## ; however , wished to wait another day , so his case was postponed .
the following day on ##/##/## , he was taken to the operating room for a left above the knee amputation .
for a detailed description of the operative procedure , please refer to the dictated operative note .
the patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged to the pacu in a stable condition .
note :
the doctor dictates the date of discharge not known at this point .

principle diagnosis :
left rotator cuff tear .
history of present illness :
the patient is a ##-year-old right handed male with a many year history of bilateral shoulder pain , right greater than left .
he has steroid injections in the right and in the left four times .
arthrogram in the distant past showed a right rotator cuff tear and he now has increased pain in his left shoulder .
mri by report showed bilateral rotator cuff repairs and he was admitted for repair of the left rotator cuff .
past medical history :
back pain .
past surgical history :
ankle surgery times two on the right .
pilonidal cyst removal .
medications :
on admission included naprosyn .
allergies :
no known drug allergies .
habits :
the patient smokes two packs per day and has an approximately a ##-pack-year history of smoking .
he has a history of drinking which he discontinued in may .
physical examination :
on admission revealed a white male with no palpable adenopathy .
heent exam was within normal limits .
lungs revealed occasional wheezing bilaterally at both bases .
heart was regular with a i / vi systolic ejection murmur without jugular venous distention .
pulses were 2+ bilaterally .
abdomen was obese with positive bowel sounds , nontender , nondistended .
examination of his shoulder revealed the patient to be able to flex his right arm to ### degrees , internally rotate to ## degrees and externally rotate to ## degrees with positive joint tenderness .
all range of motion with his right shoulder was painful .
the left shoulder was identical in range of motion and was also painful .
hospital course :
the patient was admitted with the assessment of left rotator cuff repair and he was taken to the operating room on the day of admission where he underwent left rotator cuff repair under general endotracheal tube anesthesia .
there were no intraoperative complications .
his postoperative course was generally unremarkable except for a prolonged course of advancement with range of motion of his left shoulder .
occupational therapy became involved initially and he remained on patient controlled analgesia secondary to problems with left shoulder pain .
he was kept in the hospital for an extended period to improve his postoperative range of motion .
however , he was eventually able to achieve forward flexion of ### degrees and external rotation of ## degrees by postoperative day number eight .
his wound remained clean and dry and showed no signs of infection and healed well .
however , his course was otherwise complicated by discovery of persistently elevated blood sugars and endocrinology was consulted to rule out possible newly diagnosed diabetes .
his hemoglobin a1c levels actually came back within normal limits , however , the wide excursions of his sugars were consistent with possible diabetes .
he was placed on a diabetic diet and his sugars did show some improvement .
it was not necessary to start him on oral hypoglycemics or insulin .
he also complained of occasional spells and jitteriness and some orthostatic dizziness and thus neurology was consulted and emg 's were performed which were normal .
his neurologist was contacted , dr. cap , and the exact of his problems was not demonstrated during this hospitalization , however , they felt that this could possibly be an autonomic type neuropathy maybe secondary to some underlying diabetic process .
further work-up of his neurologic conditions were planned as an outpatient .
thus , he was discharged on postoperative day number eight in good condition with a well healed left shoulder wound and doing well with occupational therapy with plans for him to follow-up with dr. necessary .

dispo :
the patient does have underlying psychiatric disease , but did meet criteria for capacity for all medical decisions during her hospitalization .
given her history of non-compliance and drug abuse , however , the team spoke with 2 family members and her psychiatrist at lumnerow health prior to discharge to review the diagnoses and the discharge plan , emphasizing the importance of making her follow-up appointments with dr. endo , dr. pulefreierm and br. still .
her family members were given phone numbers for all of her physicians to call if there are concerns that she is endangering herself with non-compliance in the future , at which time there may be further discussions regarding capacit / competency , and possible guardianship .
full code additional comments :
do not use crack again .
your difficulty breathing is partly caused by your smoking and your crack use , your symptoms will get better if you stop using tobacco and crack .
if you do decide to quit you can call ###.###.#### for help with quitting smoking , and they can direct you to help for quitting crack .
it is also very important that you keep your next appointments with your new doctors , and take all of your medications , including the inhalers , as prescribed .
the bumex will help keep extra fluid off your heart and help you breath better .
discharge condition :
satisfactory
to do / plan :
will need follow-up chest ct to check for resolution of r pleural effusion , to be checked by new pcp .

there was no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
neuro :
nonfocal .
rectal :
guaiac negative , good anal tone .
laboratory data :

his alt was ## , his ast was ## .
alkaline phosphatase of ## .
bilirubin of 0.8 .
his white count was ##.9 , hematocrit ##.7 , platelet count of ### .
his coagulation profile was within normal limits .
chest x-ray revealed a small right lower lobe infiltrate , on the ##th , with a tiny effusion on the ##th , the night of admission .
the pneumonia was now noted to be much larger , with a new right middle lobe infiltrate , as well as with a diffuse reticular interstitial pattern noted at the fringes of the pneumonic infiltrate .
sputums were sent off for gram stain and culture , as well as for afb smear cultures .
his electrocardiogram was within normal limits .
his urine sediment was basically within normal limits .
hospital course :
mr. cliffestreukote was admitted on the night of the ##th , for obvious right lung pneumonia .
the differential diagnosis included several organisms as outlined below .
(1) pneumonia .
he was admitted for a pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics for five days .
the pneumonia was found to be multilobar , and accompanied by significant hypoxia .
he was started on broad spectrum coverage , including ceftriaxone , clindamycin , and ciprofloxacin .
the ration off for the utilization of the ciprofloxacin , was that because of his allergy to erythromycin , an alternative regimen was needed to cover for legionella , which was probably the leading diagnosis at the time of admission , because of his hyponatremia accompanied by liver function abnormalities .
however , he was isolated , and three afb smears were obtained , in order to rule out tuberculosis .
in addition , sputum induction was performed for pneumocystis , which was negative .
his urinary legionella antigen subsequently came back negative .
however , this test is only ##-##% sensitive for legionella pneumophila , type i , which is the subtype that causes some ##% of legionnaires disease .
however , the legionella antigen is neither sensitive , nor specific , for other legionella species that may be involved in legionella pneumonia .
therefore , the ciprofloxacin was continued .
in addition , his sputum cultures were all negative , as of the day of admission .
after admission , with the initiation of antibiotic therapy , mr. cliffestreukote remained quite hypoxic .
however , within one to two days after admission , he defervesced with a significant decrease in his cough during the week , post admission .
because of persistent hypoxemia on room air , as well as nasal cannula , some concern was raised about the possibility of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , versus some other lesion that may predispose him for persistent hypoxemia , ( i.e. malignancy ) .
therefore , an evaluation by the pulmonary team of the tonwe hospital , as well as a sputum cytology and chest ct scan , were all obtained .
the chest ct scan revealed evidence for emphysematous changes of his lungs , as well as the previously noted right pneumonia , with several pseudo abscesses noted in infected bullae .
his sputum cytology is pending at the time of discharge .
the pulmonary team felt that the patient exhibited significant physical findings , laboratory values , and radiologic features , all consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
therefore , his persistent hypoxemia may be secondary to that underlying disease .
despite being afebrile , with significant decrease in his cough , mr. cliffestreukote will be maintained , after discharge , on eleven more days of antibiotic therapy , to complete a full course .
it should be noted , that clindamycin was discontinued , approximately three days after admission , because of the development of diarrhea .
additionally , when switched to oral medication , mr. cliffestreukote was switched to augmentin ### mg. p.o. t.i.d. , as well as continuing on his ciprofloxacin ### mg. p.o. b.i.d.
(2) hypertension .
while in the hospital , mr. cliffestreukote was maintained on hydrochlorothiazide , and verapamil sr , and required no additional medication .
(3) hyponatremia .
while in the hospital , persistent type of natremia was noted on the patient 's profile 7 labs .
it was felt that this was due largely to his pulmonary disease , and would resolve with the resolution of his intrapneumonic process .
while in the hospital , there were no complications .
discharge medications :
augmentin ### mg. p.o. t.i.d. for eleven more days , ciprofloxacin ### mg. p.o. b.i.d. for eleven days , hydrochlorothiazide ## mg. p.o. q. day , verapamil sr ### mg. p.o. q. day , and atrovent meter dose inhaler two puffs four times a day .
disposition :
his condition on discharge was stable .
he was discharged to home .
he has a followup appointment with dr. naaan jesc , in the tonwe hospital pulmonary clinic on 2-##-## , at 9:## a.m. , as well as with his primary care physician , dr. rybam selcjescpint .
his estimated disability is mild .
we are still awaiting the results of his hiv testing .

principal diagnosis :
orthostatic hypotension .
other problems :
hyponatremia .
hypokalemia .
history of present illness :
the patient is a ## year old white female without a significant past medical history who presented in the middso memorial hospital emergency room following a nine day history of dizziness on standing without loss of consciousness .
during the week prior to admission , the patient complained of severe constipation , dry mouth , possible urinary retention along with some nausea and vomiting .
she felt that she was profoundly cold at the time .
in the emergency room , the patient was hypotensive with an initial blood pressure of ##/## and a pulse of ## lying flat that became ##/## with a pulse of ### when standing .
the patient was aggressively hydrated with a total of 9 liters of normal saline over a 7 hour period with marginal increase in blood pressure .
over the same period of time , the patient became increasingly hypoxic and developed worsening hypertension .
stat chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema .
the patient was subsequently transferred to the micu on dopamine for further management .
past medical history :
only noticeable for remote appendectomy and being gravida v , para v .
medications on admission :
none .
allergies :
no known drug allergies .
social history :
the patient has an ##-pack-year history of tobacco and is currently smoking 1-2 packs per day .
she also has a questionable alcohol history of up to one quart daily .
she is married and lives with her husband .
family history :
notable for coronary artery disease in both parents without a history of cancer or autoimmune disease , diabetes , thyroid disease .
physical examination :
the patient was an agitated elderly white female .
temperature ##.8 , blood pressure ###/## on dopamine , pulse ### , respirations ## , oxygen saturation ##% on ###% nonrebreather .
heent :
showed pupils equal , round and reactive to light .
extraocular muscles intact .
oropharynx benign .
eyebrows were notable for lateral thinning .
neck was supple without lymphadenopathy .
carotids were 2+ .
no palpable thyroid .
lungs showed decreased breath sounds bilaterally .
cardiac exam revealed s1 , s2 with an intermittent s4 without murmur or rubs .
abdominal exam was benign .
extremities showed mild clubbing , no cyanosis and no edema .
neurologic exam :
the patient was alert , agitated and oriented to name , date and place moving all extremities .
light touch was intact .
admission labs :
sodium ### , potassium 2.6 , chloride ## , bicarb ## , bun ## , creatinine 0.9 , glucose ### , serum osmolality ### , hematocrit ##.5 , white count ##.0 with ##% polys , ##% lymphs and ## monos .
platelets ### .
pt and ptt were normal .
lft 's were within normal limits .
admission cortisol , aldosterone , b## and folate and tsh were drawn .
chest x-ray on transfer to the micu showed pulmonary vascular redistribution without infiltrate , effusions or nodules as compared with an admission chest x-ray which was interpreted as clear .
hospital course :
in the micu , the patient initially required dopamine for five days , at which point , she tolerated a wean without recurrent light headedness , dizziness or syncope .
echocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities .
the patient had a swan-ganz catheter placed which showed a cardiac output of 8 with systemic vascular resistance of ### .
because the swan-ganz readings were felt to be explained by sepsis , the patient was treated empirically with cefotaxime , gentamicin and flagyl .
all cultures were subsequently negative with the exception of an e coli uti .
the infectious workup included a lumbar puncture which was negative for pleocytosis but showed an elevated glucose of ### and an elevated protein of ## .
the patient had an extensive workup for hypopituitarism .
because addisonian crisis could not be initially ruled out , the patient was placed on distressed dose cortisone .
however , a random cortisol level drawn initially in the emergency room subsequently returned as normal .
the patient also responded appropriately to cortrosyn stimulation test .
also , tsh was normal on admission .
thyroid function panel drawn while the patient was on dopamine was subsequently abnormal .
however , repeat panel was drawn when the patient was stable and had been transferred to the floor and was pending at the time of discharge .
the patient was also evaluated by the neurology service for possible dysautonomia as the cause of her orthostatic hypotension with an inappropriate heart rate response to hypotension .
emg showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy .
additional studies also included a head ct that showed a small lacunar infarct in the right pons and a partial empty sella which was confirmed by head mri .
other studies sent during the workup included a negative serum and urine protein electrophoresis , negative serum and urine immunoglobulin electrophoresis .
lh and ssh levels were consistent with a post-menopausal state .
galactin levels were within normal limits .
ana was negative .
ace level was negative .
heavy metal screen was negative except for a slightly elevated cobalt level so a possibility of a perineoplastic syndrome was considered .
an anti-yo ri and who antibodies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge .
on hospital day eight , the patient had uneventfully weaned off dopamine and was transferred to the floor .
at that time , the stress dose hydrocortisone was weaned and the patient was switched to prednisone without any evidence of recurrent hypotension .
her initial hyponatremia and hypokalemia resolved with stable sodium and potassium levels prior to discharge .
in the studying of aggressive fluid resuscitation , it was felt that the patient had been sent into pulmonary edema .
the patient auto-diuresed spontaneously .
subsequent to the diuresis , reticulonodular diffuse pattern became apparent on chest x-ray .
because of the patient 's significant smoking history , chest pt was performed to evaluate the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis .
however , the chest ct showed relative sparing of the lower lobes with primary involvement in both upper lobes .
the patient following diuresis had no oxygen requirement whatsoever and had no respiratory complaints .
prior to discharge , she was evaluated by the pulmonary service who felt that the differential diagnosis for her chest ct included eosinophilic granuloma , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , less likely sarcoidosis .
because the patient had no respiratory symptoms , it was felt that her abnormal chest ct would be best evaluated as an out-patient .
a new baseline chest x-ray was obtained prior to discharge .
she will also require baseline pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .
medications on discharge :
prednisone taper ## mg p.o. q day times two days , ## mg p.o. q day times two days , ## mg p.o. q day times three days , ## mg p.o. q day times three days , 5 mg p.o. q day times three days .

condition on discharge :
stable .
disposition :
the patient will be discharged to home .
she will follow-up with jacrendonate sella , m.d. on 8/6/## .
she will need a pulmonary referral and pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .

impression and plan :
this is a ##-year-old lady with stage iv colon cancer , status post three chemo regimens , then she was on a phase one trial .
she presented with increasing lfts and renal failure .
1. hypertension , infectious disease .
the patient was hypertensive to ##s through much of her stay .
she had e. coli in her urine and she was placed on levaquin .
differential diagnosis included urosepsis and intravascular sleep depletion .
because of her rising lfts and renal failure , she was thought to be in hepatorenal , see below .
we continued to administer serum-poor albumin throughout the day even until her death .
2. renal failure .
the patient was in acute renal failure and had hypertension .
the differential diagnosis included hypertension , hypovolemia , and nephrotoxicity due to the drug , and tumor lysis leading to hepatorenal or hepatorenal in itself .
the patient had a renal ultrasound .
this showed mild left hydronephrosis , no real etiology for this .
her creatinine is slowly climbed to greater than 4.6 upon her death .
she was in fluid restriction to 1.5 litres a day .
renal failure was thought likely to be due to hypovolemia from hyperperfusion as well as hepatorenal syndrome .
we continued allopurinol .
3. increasing lfts and inr .
the patient had increasing lfts and her t. bili climbed to greater than 9 upon death .
this is likely due to hepatorenal syndrome .
also , the patient could have had the tumor metabolizing .
there was no evidence of obstruction .
4. the patient 's increased ldh , uric acid , and bun and creatinine are all consistent with tumor lysis .
this is likely thought to be due to an increased tumor burden and not necessarily from the medication .
it became clear throughout the patient 's hospital course that she was becoming very sick and the patient accepted this .
with her wishes that her she was dnr / dni , we eventually made her cmo , comfort measures only .
she was awake and entertaining friends and family through most of her hospital stay .
she often may talk openly about her death that was impending .
on the two days prior to her death , she was more unresponsive and on the day of her death , she was unconscious through most of the day .
the patient was pronounced dead at 6:## p.m. on ##/##/## .
one of her sons and her nephew were present in the room .
the family decline autopsy and the chaplain visited .

chest x-ray was low lung volumes , no consolidation .
ekg showed sinus brady at ## , normal axis , normal intervals , no stt wave abnormalities .
hospital course :
the patient was admitted to team four for cardiac monitoring and ruling out for mi .
hospital course by system :
1. cardiovascular :
the patient ruled out for mi by cardiac markers .
the patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on ##/##/## given her history of copd , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension .
the next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) .
this echo showed lv ejection fraction of ##% with no wall motion abnormality .
however , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic .
it was suboptimally imaged , so there was no rvsp given .
the patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her egd on ##/##/## .
this responded to fluid bolus .
the patient was then transferred to medicine team d given her tenuous hemodynamic status .
the patient , several days later ##/## , underwent another dobutamine stress test .
this stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the ## 's or ## 's was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an ef from this test was ##% .
clearly , the patient 's hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine .
2. infectious disease :
on hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion .
the next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential uti .
she continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , ##/##/## , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates .
she was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .
her urine legionella antigen was negative .
on ##/##/## , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum .
she was started on vancomycin for this .
these bacteria turned out to be mrsa and she was continued on her vancomycin .
she had picc line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration .
3. gi :
the patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of ##/##/## associated with some cough , apparent emesis .
gi was consulted for an egd , however , while she was in the endoscopy suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses .
finally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her egd .
the egd did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis .
her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus .
4. shortness of breath :
as mentioned above , the patient did develop mrsa pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge .
at most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula .
this was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest ct .
5. derm :
several days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast .
she was started on some miconazole cream .
the rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side .
the rash appeared to be resolving by the time of discharge .

discharge date :
##/##/##
principal diagnosis :
gait disorder .
history of present illness :
the patient is a ##-year-old right-handed female with right-sided greater than left-sided weakness and difficulty walking for several days .
she was in her usual state of health until 3/##/## when she experienced the fairly sudden onset of predominantly right-sided arm and leg weakness and ataxia .
she was standing and walking with her friend , who "" had to catch her from falling down "" as she toppled towards the right .
she evidently recovered from the episode after a number of minutes .
the following day , she remained in bed through essentially all of the day due to malaise with no specific deficits being noted .
in the subsequent two days , she had several small spells of "" imbalance "" , particularly towards the right , and other symptoms included diffuse and mainly frontal headaches and mild neck soreness .
there was no diplopia , visual loss , speech abnormality or sensory change in her history .
she was initially evaluated at an outside hospital emergency room , and then transferred to well general hospital .
past medical history :
is notable for depression , and she has been followed regularly by dr. freiermchird of nash health for several months with pharmacologic treatment , which is apparently working well .
her doxepin has recently been increased .
she is status post appendectomy and otherwise has no remarkable past medical history .
allergies :
quinine gives her a rash .

she had a normal s1 and s2 and regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs .
her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
her abdomen was benign .
her extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis , edema , or rash ; there were some older hematomas in the bilaterally shins .
mental status - her speech was fluent without errors .
her affect was slightly inappropriate at times ; for example , singing or humming along while performing some of the motor tasks and giving the impression of indifference to the deficits that were demonstrated on the examination .
her memory was fully intact for short-term recollection of three out of three objects at five minutes with excellent naming , repetition , proverb interpretation , and ability to follow commands .
visual fields were full to confrontation .
her left pupil was 7 mm reacting to 5 mm .
her right pupil was 5.5 mm reacting to 4 mm .
her extraocular movements were intact for horizontal and vertical pursuits .
there was no nystagmus and no ptosis .
her saccades were normal .

sensory - intact light touch , temperature , and vibration overall .
reflexes were 2+ throughout in the upper and lower extremities , and toes were downgoing .
there was no jaw jerk and no hoffman 's sign .
coordination - toe tap was slow bilaterally , although difficult to reproduce , and at best , was essentially within normal limits .
on standing , she tended to fall to the front , back or sides without trying to stop her fall initially , and extensive gait testing was deferred due to concerns for safety .
her heel-to-shin and finger-to-nose testing was fully intact bilaterally without ataxia or tremor .
laboratory data :
were unremarkable with normal electrolytes and complete blood count parameters .
her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was ## .
her coagulation parameters were normal .
head ct scan without contrast showed normal brain parenchyma and no intracranial process .
hospital course and treatment :
the patient was admitted for her gait disorder with other notable findings on examination including anisocoria , which , by the patient 's report , had been noted several months earlier .
a magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram study was obtained , which showed no clear evidence of arterial dissections or infarction or other pathologic processes .
she had been placed on heparin initially , but this was discontinued after the magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained .
posterior transcranial doppler studies showed normal studies of both vertebral arteries , and carotid non-invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations .
on the second hospital day , her gait continued to be markedly unstable , although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling , and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria .
she was seen by the psychiatry service .
she was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment .
the psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology .
the patient was evaluated in one of the neurology conferences for several hours , and during this time , showed significant improvement while receiving gait training as well as evaluation ; in particular , she became more stable with counter-balancing methods .
this trend of improvement continued , and she was discharged in stable condition .
she will follow up with her psychiatrist , dr. freiermchird ( sone memorial hospital ) on a regular basis , and she can follow up with the neurology service on a p.r.n. basis if needed .
she will continue on her previous outpatient medical regimen .

1) extensive posterior circulation infarction .
2) aspiration pneumonia .
history of present illness :
the patient is an ## year-old right handed gentleman who has a past medical history of hypertension and tobacco use presented to the emergency room with acute change in mental status .
he was well until the evening prior to presentation to the emergency room when he complained of headache across the forehead .
on the day of presentation , he was then found by his daughter lying on his bed groaning , being relatively unresponsive and unable to speak .
the family reported one episode of vomiting at home .
physical examination :
the patient was afebrile , heart rate ## , blood pressure ###/## , respiratory rate ##-## , oxygen saturation ##% on three liters .
general :
the patient was somnolent , breathing comfortably , occasionally coughing .
neck was supple with full range of motion .
no bruits were heard .
chest was clear to auscultation but with poor air entry .
heart sounds were regular with one out of six holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
abdomen was soft , non-tender , bowel sounds present .
extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
neurological examination revealed a patient who was intermittently alert , opening eyes to voice , following simple commands , but without any speech .
pupils were 4 mm reactive to 2 mm bilaterally .
there was no pupillary defect .
dolls eye was negative .
there was a possible right gaze preference and the patient did not move his eyes .
corneals were present bilaterally .
gag was present weakly .
face was symmetrical .
tongue was midline .
the patient was moving the right side spontaneously , but could not hold arm or leg up for any length of time .
there was only minimal movement on the left side .
on sensory testing , the patient withdrew all extremities to pain .
reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical all over .
the left toe was upgoing , the right toe was downgoing .
laboratory :
laboratory data revealed a sodium of ### , potassium 3.4 , chloride ### , bicarbonate ## , bun ## , creatinine 1.2 , glucose ### .
ast was ## , alt ## , alkaline phosphatase ## , bilirubin 0.5. ck was ### .
thyroid function tests were normal .
troponin i was 0.## .
total protein was 8 , albumin 4.3 , globulin 3.7 , calcium 9.9 , phosphate 2.7 , magnesium 2.0. white blood cell count was 7 , hemoglobin ##.1 , hematocrit ##.6 , platelet count ### .
erythrocyte sedimentation rate was ## .
pt was ##.3 , ptt ##.1. an ekg showed sinus bradycardia at ## with a normal axis , first degree atrioventricular block , biphasic t-waves in v1 to v3 without any acute changes .
a chest x-ray shows left lower lobe consolidation .
the head ct scan revealed a large right occipital infarct without midline shift , but positive mass effect on the temporal horn , on the right ventricle and some effacement of the sulci in the right parietal area .
hospital course :
the patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin .
around 4:## am the next day , an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted .
lung examination at that point showed good air entry , no wheezing , coarse breath sounds throughout .
neurologically , the patient was not following commands .
eyes were closed .
he was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously , though less than before .
withdrawal to pain was still present .
both plantars were upgoing .
a blood gas at this point showed a ph of 7.## , po2 ## , pco2 of ## on ###% non-rebreather mask .
ekg showed sinus tachycardia .
the patient 's temperature was ### degrees .
a repeat cat scan of the head was performed .
this showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere .
there was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage .
at this point , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit .
an mri and mra of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation .
the mri showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally , the right occipital lobe , the right thalamus and bilateral pons .
the mra of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries .
the left vertebral artery was not visualized .
there was a dominant right vertebral artery .
there was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left .
there was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries .
clinically , the patient continued to deteriorate .
neurosurgery was consulted , however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation .
the patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management .
heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage .
the aspiration pneumonia was treated with cefotaxime and metronidazole .
the patient 's family was involved and they decided to opt for dnr / dni in view of the poor prognosis .

identification data :
the patient is a ##-year-old female with a ## week intrauterine pregnancy who was transferred from bri health with diffuse metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary .
history of present illness :
the patient was in her usual state of excellent health until july of #### when she first noted a left clavicular mass .
subsequently , the mass continued to increase in size .
on ##/## , she was seen by dr. stonge at bri health where a 3 x 7 cm left mid clavicular mass was noted .
a fine needle aspirate of this mass reportedly revealed giant cell tumor .
the patient was initially told that this was a benign tumor and that it could simply be watched and definitively treated after the delivery of her baby .
subsequently , the mass progressively increased in size and the patient had developed significant discomfort in this region .
on 1/5 , the patient underwent a local tumor debulking at bri health under local anesthesia .
the pathology , unfortunately , revealed an aggressive adenocarcinoma ( micropapillary type ; mucin producing ) .
this prompted further staging work-up .
the patient subsequently had a limited chest ct at bri health which showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases , metastases to the sternum , rib , multiple spinal levels ; internal mammary lymphadenopathy .
the poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal ct scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .
there was no obvious gior pancreatic tumor identified .
the patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .
a specimen was obtained by fine needle aspiration and the pathology of this was consistent with adenocarcinoma .

hospital course :
the patient had an elective termination of her pregnancy on 1/##/## .
the work-up for the extent of the patient 's disease included mri scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a t3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .
an epidural mass was present at t## which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .
an abdominal and pelvic ct scan with iv contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic ivc and distention of the azygous system suggestive of ivc obstruction by liver metastases ; ascites ; multiple bony metastases ; and an isolated splenic metastases .
a bone scan revealed increased uptake in the left chest wall , left anterior ribs four to six , and increased uptake in the left and right lateral skull in the area of the parotids .
ahead ct scan revealed a metastatic lesion in the right vertex of the calvarium but no intracranial abnormalities .
work-up for the source of the primary tumor which is still unknown included a mammogram which identified no suspicious microcalcifications and no dominant masses .

ivc obstruction :
the patient has extensive hepatic metastases and by ct scan there is obstruction of the intrahepatic ivc .
this has resulted in marked bilateral lower extremity and presacral edema with ascites .
the patient 's low serum albumin is also contributing to her extensive edema .
hypoxia and shortness of breath :
although the patient 's room air saturation was ##% during this admission , she subjectively complained of increased shortness of breath .
it was felt that the patient 's extensive pulmonary metastases and bilateral pleural effusions resulted in increased work of respiration and a sensation of shortness of breath .

at that time clear liquids were started .
all of her stools were guaiaced .
she also began nadolol ## mg qd to reduce her portal hypertension .
the gi consult team continued to follow her .
we also tried to contact her physician at va sit namar healthcare and was unsuccessful .
therefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .
she was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .
her ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .
she also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .
over the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .

the serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .
the cell count showed a white blood cell count of ### with ##% polys .
she therefore _________ criteria for a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis .
her platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to cimetidine .
therefore we switched her cimetidine to prilosec .
by the 2th the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .
she wanted to be closer to north dakota .
after discussion with her private physician , dr. joasscchird , tel. ###-###-#### , at va sit namar healthcare and dr. acrookesjo at do of hospital , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with ah and physical therapy .
she was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .
she is to follow up with dr. acrookesjo in one week and dr. work the gastrointestinal fellow here at puomc in 2 weeks .
she may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding .
the patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker , therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient .

the patient 's seizure was thought to be secondary to hypoglycemia in the setting of decreased oral intake on her standard anti-glycemic medications .
she will be transferred back to her long term care facility on a czi sliding scale for close management of her sugars pending further assessment of her baseline anti-glycemic medication needs .
2. neurological :
the patient has a history of transient ischemic attacks in the past .
her seizure was thought secondary to hypoglycemia and she had no further seizure activity in the hospital .
she did have some slightly paranoid behavior which her son says is typical .
she was continued on her trazodone , neurontin and zyprexa .
3. cardiovascular :
the patient had an echocardiogram which revealed a normal ejection fraction , no wall motion abnormalities but mitral stenosis with peak gradient of ## and mean gradient of 9 , dilated right ventricle , dilated right atrium , and right ventricle systolic pressure in the ##s .
she was aggressively diuresed and her shortness of breath somewhat improved as did her pedal edema .
after discussion with her primary care physician it was decided that she would have further cardiology assessment as an outpatient .

this was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly a hematocrit drop secondary to in-hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and p.o. hydration .
patient did not show coincident decrease in white count or platelet count .
a clot was sent to the blood bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion .
she did receive bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow .

3) urinary tract infection - patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on ##/##/## and was thus begun on bactrim ds one tablet p.o. b.i.d.
subsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive e. coli , greater than l##,### including sensitivities to bactrim .
patient received a seven day course of bactrim ds one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture .
her foley will be discontinued at discharge and she will continue home straight catheterizations given her post-void residual of ### cc on admission per the visiting nurse .

vital signs :
heart rate ## , blood pressure ###/## .
general :
this is a pleasant ## year-old man whose distressed .
heent , normocephalic , atraumatic , well healed right jaw incision , slight swelling right jaw slightly tender to the touch , there is no erythema .
lungs are clear to auscultation .
heart regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , gallops or rubs .
abdomen g-tube intact , soft non-tender , active bowel sounds .
neurological alert and oriented times three , speech is fluent although there is some difficulty of tongue movement .
cranial nerves , right visual field deficit , decreased gag , tongue is atrophic and deviates to the right .
strength five out of five bilateral upper and lower extremities .
deep tendon reflexes 2+ symmetric , toes downgoing .
cerebella intact .
gait steady .
hospital course :
this ## year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on jan ## , #### a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy .
postoperatively , he was taken to the neurosurgical intensive care unit where he remained intubated .
he was extubated on postoperative day number one .
his neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .
he was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating .
he was seen by physical therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker .
he noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak .
on postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .
he vomited once and had intermittent headaches .
a head ct was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the c2 level .
a lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days ## cc was drained every eight hours .
a culture taken from the lumbar drain showed staphylococcus aureus resistant to the nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on vancomycin .
he was also receiving ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both vancomycin and ofloxacin .
he was followed by the speech pathology team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration .
a video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .
because of continuing complaints by mr. marker about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the g-tube feedings were not ideal .
he underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the interventional radiologist on feb ## , #### .
prior to admission mr. marker had been taking one can of jevity every two hours as a bolus .
after conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however mr. marker did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .
it was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings .
his visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .
his lumbar drain was removed after five days .
he was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .
he is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .
medications on discharge :
1) ofloxacin ### mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week .
2) jevity plus one can q.2h.
he will have visiting nurse and home physical therapy services .
follow-up :
follow-up will be with dr. sick in one weeks time .
he will needed a follow-up ct or mri for the pseudomeningocele .
addendum
mr. marker will be restarted on his preoperative aspirin as he is now far enough out from his surgery .
medications on discharge :
1) aspirin ### mg p.o. q.d.
2) ofloxacin ### mg p.o. b.i.d. times seven days .

chief complaint :
epiglottitis .
history of present illness :
this is an ## year old white female who is otherwise healthy by history and presented with a several day history of upper respiratory infection .
of note , the patient does not smoke and does not drink .
she was seen by her local internist after having several days of blood-tinged sputum which she was coughing up and some mild throat discomfort .
she did not complain of significant pain and was able to tolerate p.o.s.
she denied any respiratory distress although her family thought she may have had some labored breathing at one point .
she was seen by her local physician who was concerned that she may have a malignancy secondary to the history of hemoptysis and throat discomfort .
he recommended that she see a local otolaryngologist .
examination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had no true record of what was seen .
there was also a question of a carcinomatous lesion on the left side of the epiglottis .
apparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to ez ephtro health center where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised .
the patient 's granddaughter , however , works at retelk county medical center and therefore the family elected to bring the patient home and then bring her to retelk county medical center .
she presented to the emergency room with some throat discomfort , some mild hoarseness , which she said had been progressing over the last few days .
she was sitting straight upright although was not having any respiratory distress .
she did report a lot of salive in the back of her throat .
she was febrile to ###.7 .
ent consult was obtained .
a lateral neck film revealed significant swelling of the epiglottis .
ent examination was then to be performed .
chest x-ray showed significant kiphosis but otherwise no significant lesions at all .
past medical history :
negative .
past surgical history :
negative .
medications on admit :
none .
allergies :
none .
smoking none .
family history :
negative .
alcohol none .
social history :
lives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent .
physical examination :
the patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination .
she had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position .
her ear examination was normal .
nasal examination was normal .
oral cavity was normal .
neck :
revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant mass .
neck :
otherwise normal and the trachea was midline .
hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema .
the left pyriform was obliterated by edema .
the right pyriform was narrowed by edema .
the epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx .
the patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis .
there was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area .
lungs :
clear .
heart :
regular rate and rhythm .
s1 and s2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
abdomen :
soft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits .
no masses .
extremities :
normal .
back :
showed significant thoracic kiphosis .
laboratory examination :
revealed a wbc count of ##.6 , h and h of ##.7 and ##.7 , platelet count of ### , differential ## polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono .
as noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis .
the chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative .
hospital course :
the patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .
she was started on iv ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .
due to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the operating room emergently for elective intubation .
she was taken to the operating room at approximately 2:## a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ent and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .
the patient was sedated .
direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct mass or lesion could be noted .
she was transferred to the sicu where she was kept sedated and was given ceftriaxone one gram q. ## h. as well as iv steroids for the first ## hours consisting of decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. x 3 doses in addition to ## mg that she received in the emergency room on the way down to the operating room .
her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the operating room .
at the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the sicu house office .
her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the operating room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed .
she had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to ### .
she was given a dose of digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the digoxin was given .
ekg and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree av block that she had had on her preoperative ekg but no other findings at all .
she continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the icu where she was monitored .
her blood gases and o2 saturations correlated well and we used o2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good o2 saturation .
she was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated .
she went into an svt the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 .
she continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of svt and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that .
her edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both 4/3 and 4/4 revealed decreasing edema .
on 4/5/## in the icu under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems .
she was kept on ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given .
examination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold .
otherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .
of note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .
once the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .
tube feedings were started on 4/3/## and the ng tube was discontinued on 4/5/## prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .
after extubation she was watched in the icu for ## hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .
again , mi was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .
o2 saturations looked good .
it was felt that this was a mild episode of icu psychosis .
she was followed on the regular floor ## hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway .
she was maintained on ceftriaxone and then switched to augmentin and remained afebrile .
her white counts came down .
blood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .
she had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .
cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all digoxin and just watched and that her svts may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .
unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and svt were apparently not documented well enough in terms of ekg strips to aid cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .
nonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of digoxin and had no further problems with her heart .
her mental status began to clear under the family 's request .
disposition :
on 4/9/## she was sent home on a week of augmentin and will followup in the ent clinic .
our plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .
she , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .
if she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy .
discharge medications are augmentin ### mg t.i.d. x 7 days .
the patient is to followup in the ent clinic in approximately one week .
discharge diagnosis :
epiglottitis , question secondary to epiglottic malignancy .

history of present illness :
the patient is a ###y year old female who presented initially to the medical service on ##/## complaining of weight loss , nausea , vomiting and abdominal distention .
she reported that she was remarkably healthy until the latter part of ##/## , when her granddaughter noticed her to be jaundiced .
since that time she had yellow colored stools .
on ##/## she was taken to the rys memorial hospital hospital , where she was diagnosed with choledocholithiasis .
an ercp showed stones in the common bile duct but they could not be recovered .
therefore she was transferred to ph university of medical center and admitted there from ##/## - ##/## .
an ercp was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
the distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .
the stones were then removed .
the distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .
she was discharged home .
approximately one month prior to admission she developed anorexia , increased abdominal girth , weight loss of ## lb , and nausea and vomiting .
she presented to the emergency room , where a nasogastric tube was placed and drained approximately ### of green-brown , thick fluid .
she was admitted for workup of her symptoms .

kub :
large , approximately ## cm stomach filled with fluid .
chest x-ray :
clear lungs .
ekg :
left bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at ## , non-specific st-t wave changes .
hospital course :
the patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .
the patient was seen in consultation by the gastroenterology service and it was decided that an esophagogastroduodenoscopy would be performed .
prior to this study , however , a ct examination of the abdomen was obtained which showed a mass in the porta causing biliary ductal dilatation proximally and gastric outlet obstruction .
on ##/## an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed , which showed gastric outlet obstruction , a deformed pylorus and a duodenal mass encasing and obstructing the lumen .
it appeared that there was a large tumor mass obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .
the general surgery service was involved at this stage , and on ##/## a posterior gastrojejunostomy with wedge liver biopsy was performed to facilitate gastric drainage .
pathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .
the patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .
however , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .
it was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools clay colored .
after discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .
the patient 's subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .
she complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .
as she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .
the best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .

2. pulmonary embolus , 1-##-## .
3. diarrhea , nausea and vomiting , fever .
4. history of ovarian cyst resection , #### .
history of present illness :
the patient is a ## year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with pbse and ccss support ending june #### .
she was admitted on 1-5-## for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .
the patient first presented in october #### with a tender right axillary mass .
a mammogram done in november #### was negative .
however , mammography repeated in october #### showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .
fine needle aspiration on october ## , #### demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .
staging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .
bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .
dr. berca gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on november 4 , #### .
the right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , grade iii out of iii infiltrating ductal carcinoma .
the margins were free of tumor , but ## out of ## lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .
furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .
the left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .
estrogen receptor was 0% by erica .
the patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .
therefore she had a stage iii-a adenocarcinoma of the breast .
since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .
the patient was treated with cmsap , which is cytoxan , methotrexate , leukovoranrescue , 5-fu , adriamycin and prednisone for four cycles .
there were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .
however , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .
abgs showed a po2 of ## , ph 7.## , po2 ## .
chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .
the differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , mycoplasma , chlamydia .
basically in december #### , she returned to the hem / onc clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .
although she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver ct were negative for metastatic disease .
she was thus started on a protocol of high dose chemotherapy with gcsf and peripheral stem cell support .
complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .
she also developed klebsiella uti after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .
it was treated with gent and cipro .
re-staging done in april #### showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .
in may #### she received her first course of thiotepa and velban and methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .
in mid may she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a uti with blood clots in the urine .
the patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of ### .
she has also been having diarrhea since november and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .
we will include a very thorough hpi with this dictation that was done by dr. wedleung .
past medical history :
significant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia .
utis , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster .
status post ovarian cyst resection in #### .
she had menarche at age ## .
she used the pill for five years in the past .
she is g 2 , p 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries .
she has a history of easy bruis ability .
she is allergic to augmentin which gives her a rash .
medications :
ms contin , msir , and percocet .
family history :
noncontributory .
social history :
married with two children .
she worked as an occupational therapist at a professional center for handicapped children .
she denies tobacco and drug use and drinks ethanol socially .
physical examination :
a cachectic white female .
t ###.1 , p ### , blood pressure ###/## , heart rate of ## , she was sating ##% on room air .
heent - pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light .
neck - tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly .
lungs were clear .
chest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus .
cardiovascular - normal .
abdomen - normal .
there was no hsm .
extremities - her left arm was very swollen .
it was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .
there was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .
neuro - the patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .
she also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .
cranial nerves ii - xii were grossly intact .
toes were downgoing .
laboratory data :
of note - na ### , k 4 , wbc 8.## , hematocrit ##.1 , platelets ### .
pt ##.8 with an inr of 1.3 , ptt ##.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .
alt was elevated at ### , ast ## , ldh ### , alk phos ## , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 .
cholesterol ### , triglyceride was ### .
ua - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .
chest x-ray - showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .
in summary , the patient is a ## year old woman with metastatic breast cell ca , status post chemotherapy with cmsap and pvsc and xrt who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .
the keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .
when she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with iv antibiotics .
so she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .
also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .
she refused the taxol therapy so that was not done .
another major issue with this patient was pain control .
she had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .
so pain control was a big issue so she was on ms contin and msir at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .
one of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at c6-c7 interface on 1-6-## .
after that the patient had minimal relief of pain .
however , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .
so accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .
she is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .
she is now getting ## micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every ## hours .
we can go up by ## mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .
other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead ct for her on the 8th of january because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .
we went ahead and got a head ct scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .
in addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .
that has been stable .
the patient on january ## became hyponatremic .
her sodium went down to ### and before that on admission she was ### .
a renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as siadh .
we proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .
we had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .
in addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between ### and ### ; prior to that it had gone down to as low ###.
so that has really improved .
we suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .
on the ##th of january , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with hampton 's hump .
also a vq scan obtained the next day showed high probability for pe .
so we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.
her inr is 2.3 .
we want her inr to remain between 2 and 3 .
so if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .
however , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .
other major issues - as a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .
we put her on nifedipine ir , sl and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the ###s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .
so on discharge she is on atenolol ### .
if needed to you can give her some nifedipine sl to decrease her blood pressure .
the patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so i think that fluid restriction should help with that .
she is also a little dry .
the patient is on oxygen .
ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .
she was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating ## to ##% on 5 liters .
we would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .
the complications that i have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .
disposition :
discharge medications - baclofen ## p.o. t.i.d. , mvi one tablet p.o. q.d. , mycostatin powder tp q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , colace ### mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch ## micrograms per hour topical q## hours , atenolol ### mg p.o. q.d.
condition on discharge :
fair .
she remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .
she is to go to the necsoncardel medical center for more chronic care .
follow-up is with dr. wedleung in the hem / onc in two weeks .
the appointment has already been made .
the patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .

physical examination on admission :
the patient was afebrile .
heart rate was ## , blood pressure ##/## , respiratory rate of ## , satting ##% on four liters .
in general , this is an obese male in mild respiratory distress .
neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy .
heent - normocephalic / atraumatic , extraocular movements are intact , pupils equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation .
chest had diffuse crackles bilaterally halfway up .
coronary - irregular pvcs , s1 , s2 normal , positive systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border radiating throughout .

no clubbing or cyanosis .
neurologic examination - alert and oriented x 3 , slurred and slow speech , distractable .

laboratory data :
white blood count 4.## , hematocrit ##.1 with platelets of ###,### , mcv ## .
sodium ### , potassium 4.5 , chloride## , bicarb ## , bun ### , creatinine 4.1 , glucose ### , ast ## , alt## , alkaline phosphatase ### , total bili 1.6 , calcium 9.2 , magnesium 2.3 , albumin 3.4 .
hospital course :
1. gastrointestinal .
the patient had an elevated bilirubin on admission with decreased output of biliary drain .
the drain was replaced over the wire , 8-## by ir , when it was accidentally removed .
increased flow again .
the patient had signs and symptoms develop of sbp , also with an elevated white count .
he was treated broadly with amp , levo and flagyl .
cultures were negative and onlyon one gram stain did it show rare gram negative rods .
the patient 's abdominal fluid cell counts showed #### white blood cells , ### red cells with ## polyps , ## lymphs , 7 monos .
clinically , this was consistent with sbp , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer .
he underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic .
this had to be performed by ir because the pocket was too deep to access from the bedside .
he received a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics and will be maintained on levofloxacin iv for prophylaxis against sbp .
2. pulmonary .
from a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath .
his apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved .
chest xray was consistent with pleurodesis .
however , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids .
on the day of discharge , he is stating approximately ## to ##% on three to four liters .
chest xray is still consistent with volume overload .
the plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and lasix to mobilize his fluid .
3. cardiovascular .
he had episodes of bradycardia without subsequent fall in blood pressure at the beginning of his admission .
he was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
echocardiogram showed ##% ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation .
he did not show any episodes of bradycardia throughout the remainder of his hospital course .
4. endocrine .
diabetes .
his avandia was discontinued secondary to the side effect profile .
he is being maintained on glipizide and sliding scale insulin .
5. heme .
from a heme standpoint , he presented anemic and with an elevated pt inr .
he required a few transfusions during his hospital course .
he also required ffp initially to reverse his coagulopathy .
however , this resolved on its own over the hospital course .
his inr normalized , however , unfortunately , he developed bilateral deep venous thromboses during his hospital course and will be maintained on lovenox .
6. renal .
he had a creatinine of 4.0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid , currently at 1.7 on discharge .
from his urinalysis , he has mostly a prerenal state .
however , he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state .
at the time , nutrition was following , initially with a low fat , low cholesterol , low sugar diet .
his appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses , therefore , we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes .
7. id .
please see gi .
he was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a ## day course for clinical sbp .
he will be maintained on levofloxacin for prophylaxis against sbp .
given that he will need continued taps,
8. oncology .
the patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy .
however , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and i do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him .
his pain here has been controlled , initially on oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain .
as he becomes progressively more somnolent , this will likely need to be switched to iv pain medications only .
discussion , at that point in time , should occur with the family about comfort measures and about weaning him from his medications to make him more comfortable .
code status - the patient is a dnr / dni .
this is an unfortunate case but mr. po does have an incredibly supportive family who have been here consistently to visit him and that offers him an important source of comfort .
discharge medications :
tylenol , ### mg p.o. q 4 prn ; allopurinol , ### mg p.o. q.d. ; peridex mouthwash , ## ml b.i.d.; cholysteramineresin , 4 grams p.o. q.d. ; clotrimazole , one troche p.o. q.i.d. ; fentanyl patch , ### mcg per hour topical q ## hours ; glipizide , ## mg p.o. q.d.; atarax , ## operating table ## mg p.o. q 6 to 8 hours prn itching ; regular sliding scale insulin ; kbl mouthwash , ## ccp .o. q.d. prn mouth discomfort ; lactulose , ## ml p.o. q.i.d. that was started on january ## , for no bowel movements with instructions to continue until bowel movement and then decrease to b.i.d. or q.d. ; lidocaine , 2% , ## ml ur q 3 to 4 hours prn for pain around foley site ; ativan , 0.## to 0.5 mg iv q 4 to 6 hours prn anxiety with instructions to use caution .

hospital course by system :
the patient was admitted for intravenous antibiotics for possible cellulitis of the right hand .
she was initially given ancef iv .
she was transferred to the medical intensive care unit on the second day of her admission due to hypercarbic respiratory distress .
her blood gas at that time was ph 7.## , bicarb ## , oxygen ## , chest x-ray was felt to be consistent with fluid overload .
there was also a question of left lower lobe infiltrate and effusion .
she was also covered with levofloxacin empirically for pneumonia .
she was started on nasal bipap and repeat arterial blood gas on the bipap was ph 7.## , pco2 1.## , and po2 ### .
her code status was visited with her family .
they felt the cause of her dyspnea was potentially reversible , and that she would want aggressive management at that time .
1. respiratory :
the patient was intubated with goal of decreasing her pco2 .
this was accomplished and her arterial blood gas improved ph 7.## , pco2 ## , and po2 ### .
she had abronchoscopy on ##/##/#### which revealed a left lower lobe basal segment tumor versus mucous plug versus edematous versus foreign body aspiration .
the patient self-extubated on ##/##/#### and was maintained on intermittent noninvasive positive pressure ventilation until the time of her death .

her admitting hematocrit was ##% , white count 7,### , with an mcv of ## , platelets were normal at ###,### .
albumin 2.5 .
hospital course :
# 1. cerebrovascular accident .
the patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery .
this was determined by head ct , head mri , head mra , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial dopplers .
the possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and holter monitor .
her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace mr was present .
previous echoes have shown mvp at the ona hospital .
her holter showed up to ## beats of svt , but was otherwise unremarkable .
the patient had a normal b## , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization .
she was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days coumadin was started .
her exact coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day .
her pro time and ptt have normalized at the time of discharge .
she needs to be given 5 mg of coumadin tonight , 5/##/## .
in addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at ### units an hour .
it is discontinued at the time of transport .
the patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete .
during evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate .
on our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown .
there are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen .
at the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient 's family strongly requested that she be transferred to the sas general hospital .
what follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia .
her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain .
moreover her mri did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions .
our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast ca .
as i mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time .
while mammogram and ca-##.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast ca has reared its head .
two possible markers are anti-hu syndrome and anti-yo antibody .
these tests were sent on the ##th and are pending at the time of discharge .
the results can be obtained by paging me , do a. joasscchird , m.d. at ###-###-#### .
i will be happy to furnish the results .
the patient has a history of mi in #### .
echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities .
ekg , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral q/wave inversion .
we would like to discontinue her isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .
persantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .
the patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .
it has been evaluated in the past without success .
during her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .
studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .
studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her rr interval evaluation was not abnormal .
this is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .
florinef is to be considered , however stopping the isordil is one goal .
the patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .
in addition there is a distant history of m. kansasaii infection .
this has been evaluated by dr. screen at sas general hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .
ct at the ona hospital in #### showed similar findings .

there were no known drug allergies .
habits :
did not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion .
physical examination :
on physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only .
chest was clear .
heart had regular rate and rhythm .
neck was supple without mass or bruits .
the abdomen was soft and nontender .
calves were nontender .
on neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation .
she looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time .
her face was strong and symmetric .
she felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically .
her extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus .
she sees light only od. which is chronic .
she reads large print os.
her tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically .
she could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift .
she also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees .
her grip is 5/5 bilaterally .
ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally .
laboratory data :
on admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of ##.9 , white blood count ##.1 , mcv ## , sodium ### , potassium 3.0 , chloride ### , bicarb. ##.3 , bun ## , creatinine 0.9 and sugar ### .
a head ct performed on ##/##/## revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood .
mra / mri revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width .
hospital course :
the patient was admitted to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on ##/##/## .
this revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left .
this was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
the internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis .
after much discussion , endovascular treatment with gd coils were recommended .
the patient underwent coiling on ##/##/## .
this showed that ##-##% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils .
one coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
it was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe .
also the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism .
therefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil .
therefore after discussion in detail with sister rora dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on ##/##/## .
at this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic .
therefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm .
the patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name .
her pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed .
her consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .
discharge diagnosis :
subarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm .

history of present illness :
mr. warm is an ## year old man with chronic congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization .
over the last four to five months , mr. warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily pnd and orthopnea .
he has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator .
although in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery .
the patient lives independently with his wife in connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately .
he has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising .
he does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes .
physical examination on admission :
on examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age .
his blood pressure was ###/## .
heart was ## and regular .
respiratory rate was ## .
his jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ .
lungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales .
the first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced .
there was an s3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla .
the abdomen was soft and nontender .
there was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex .
the extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused .
the posterior tibialis pulses were intact .
laboratory data :
sodium ### , potassium 5.0 , bun ## , creatinine 1.9 , glucose ## .
albumin 3.6 , hematocrit ## , white count 8.6 , platelets ### and pt ##.6 seconds .
the chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion .
the ecg was paced .
an outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of ## mms. , an lv of ## mms. , ejection fraction of ##% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of ## , a mean gradient of ## , an ejection fraction of ##% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis .
there was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated rv peak systolic pressure of ## and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle .
hospital course :
the patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of ## , pulmonary artery pressure of ##/## with a mean of ## , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared .
the aortic valve gradient was approximately ## mms of mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared .
coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals .
left ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of ##% .
there was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views .
in addition , there was a ##% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself .
the patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications .
the patient was seen in consultation by dr. win shufffyfe of the cardiac surgery service and after a long discussion with the patient , dr. shufffyfe and the patient 's family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient 's age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease .
while in hospital , the patient was seen by lenni breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest .
the patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately ## seconds with one episodes of ## seconds with a desaturation to ##% .
the patient was fitted with a cpap apparatus with titration of 8-## cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient .
in addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night .
at the time of discharge , the patient 's vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of ### lbs .
he will be followed both by dr. warm closely upon return to his son 's home in connecticut and by gie lung of the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital heart failure partners home care program .

in the setting of inadvertently decreasing lasix from ## mg. po ## mg. a day mr. state had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .
upon arrival in the emergency room mr. state 's saturations were in the mid ##s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous lasix .
chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the emergency room as noted .
the patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .
past medical history :
is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an fev1 of .9 and fvc of 1.## and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in may , #### apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an lvid of ## mm. and ejection fraction of ## percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of ## and a mean gradient of ## and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .
in addition , mr. state has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .
his cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ana , negative spep , upep and benz-jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .
the patient lives on quelene with his wife .
he is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .
physical examination :
the patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .
blood pressure was ###/## , heart rate ## with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations ## .

the urinalysis was negative .
the troponin i was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was ### .
chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .
the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .
hospital course :
the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first ## hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .
after a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .
prior to catheterization a vq scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for pe with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .
subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and d-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .
it was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .
coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .
after a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ## , pulmonary vacuolar resistance ### and the cardiac output depressed at 2.## liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .
based upon these findings it was felt that mr. state most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .
in hospital he was seen by both speech therapy , physical therapy , and the uspend harmemewood medical center congestive heart failure nurse practitioner program .
his isordil was increased in hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between ### and ### .
future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .

it was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .
coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .
after a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ## , pulmonary vacuolar resistance ### and the cardiac output depressed at 2.## liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .
based upon these findings it was felt that mr. bridge most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .
in hospital he was seen by both speech therapy , physical therapy , and the uspend harmemewood medical center congestive heart failure nurse practitioner program .
his isordil was increased in hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between ### and ### .
future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .
at a goal weight of ### pounds , mr. bridge 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of ## and his goal weight range will be between ### and ## pounds at home .
the patient will be followed by dr. fraction within a week of discharge and by nieie naebrand freierm of the dyathenslycha medical center .

hospital course :
1 ) cardiovascular :
the patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
she remained on telemetry for greater than ## hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .
the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .
the patient was maintained on her aspirin and lasix .
the patient 's diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of ###-### systolic in her right arm .
the patient also underwent an adenosine mibi stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .
at this time , the patient 's presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .
2 ) neurological / vascular :
the discrepancy in the patient 's pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .
the patient underwent mri / mra of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .
the left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .
the patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck mra .
mri of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct .
the patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease .
the patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .
the results of these studies suggested that the patient 's symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .
a neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient 's intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .
3 ) orthopedic :
the patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .
outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view .
repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new .
an orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with physical therapy assistance .
a bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative .
at the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of physical therapy and a walker .
plans were made for the patient to be discharged to dwardmegriff rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture .
4 ) gastrointestinal :
the patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted .
the patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation .
the patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement .
however , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently .
the patient 's emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood .
the etiology of the patient 's nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract .
the patient was started on meclizine on december ## , #### for her nausea and vertigo .
an attempt was also made to reduce the patient 's large number of medications and the patient 's os-cal , multivitamin , lasix and colace were discontinued .
5 ) infectious disease :
the patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on december ## , #### .
urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection .
the patient was started on levofloxacin ### mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection .

admission date :
##/##/####
report status :
signed
discharge date :
##/##/####
principal diagnosis :
ruptured parathyroid adenoma .
history of present illness :
ms. shuffa is a ##-year-old portuguese speaking woman who was transferred via med flight to verg medical center .
she arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm .
she initially presented to brottlake medical center on 9/##/## complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids .
while she was in brottlake medical center , she developed new onset stridor , and an ent consult was obtained .
they attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway .
she was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest .
given these findings , she underwent a ct scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus .
this raised concerns for a hemorrhage , and she was transferred to verg medical center emergently .
at the ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center , she underwent an emergent ct scan with iv contrast .
this revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm .
however , it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma .
she was admitted to the thoracic surgery service under the care of dr. sccrookes .
past medical history :
severe hypertension , angina , gerd , peptic ulcer disease , status post billroth ii , ovarian cancer , status post tah-bso in #### with a negative second look laparotomy in #### , chronic anemia , chronic left ear infection .
medications prior to admission :
celexa ## mg p.o. q.d.; lasix ## mg p.o. q.d.; capoten ## mg p.o. b.i.d.; pepcid ## mg p.o. q.d.; cardizem ### mg p.o. q.d.; xanax 0.5 mg tabs .
on transfer , she was on her preadmission medications plus unasyn and tigan ### mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.
allergies :
no known drug allergies .
social history :
she is divorced and retired .
she lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use .
physical examination :
the patient is intubated .
vital signs :
temperature ##.6 , ## .
right arm was ###/## , left ###/## , and a-line was ###/## .
tidal volume is ### with a rate of ## , ## of pressure support , and ## of peep , and ###% fio2 , satting ###% .
general :
she was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities .
neck :
edematous .
trachea was midline .
she had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck .
the superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts .
she had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region .
her anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis .
lungs :
she had bilateral expiratory wheezes .
abdomen :
soft with good bowel sounds .
it was nontender .
it was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant .
both were easily reducible .
pulse :
on the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , dp , pt , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , dp , pt , and radial .
laboratory data :
cbc was 8.7 , ##.3 , and ### .
coags ##.2 , ##.8 , and 1.0 .
her gas was 7.##/##/### .
electrolytes were ### , 3.4 , ### , ## , ## , 3 , and ### .
ekg showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block .
ct scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air .
it was consistent with a hematoma .
hospital course :
ms. shuffa underwent an egd and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/##/## shortly after she arrived .
this showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time .
she was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator .
the differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor .
on 9/##/## , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy .
a biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma .
the operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot .
there was no active bleeding at the time .
over the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator .
she had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma .
the ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level .
given these findings , she underwent a sestamibi scan .
the sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid .
at this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma .
dr. ear brought the patient to the operating room on ##/5/## .
she underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy .
she tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the surgical intensive care unit with her new tracheostomy working well .
her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left .
this required a chest tube .
her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding .
it was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest .
however , we are not quite sure why this was occurring .
she underwent an extensive workup by hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology .
it turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology .
in conclusion , by systems :
1. neuro .
the patient became intermittently agitated .
we have been giving her haldol at bedtime as well as ativan p.r.n. throughout the day .
she responds well to this .
she speaks some english and seems to understand more than she speaks .
she has a family member who is present for approximately ## hours each day .
she has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that ms. shuffa is in good spirits .
2. cardiac .
the patient 's blood pressure has been ranging from approximately ### to ### systolic .
this is on a current regimen of lopressor ## mg per ng tube t.i.d. as well as diltiazem ## mg per ng tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril ## mg per ng tube q.d. she occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .
for this , we have given her ## mg of hydralazine .
her blood pressure responds well to this .
otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .
the patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a greenfield filter .
this has been followed by the vascular surgery service here at the ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center .
dr. lenni lung has been consulted .
the aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .
they elected not to inject it with thrombin .
they asked that the patient follow-up with dr. ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .
they have opted for conservative management given the size .
3. respiratory .
at the time of discharge , the patient remained on cpap with a peep of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .
she seems to be tolerating this well as she has an o2 sat of ###% on ##% fio2 .
her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .
her right lung field is clear .
her tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it .
she will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated .
we had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week .
with the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to ## .
her oxygen saturation has always been good .
4. gi .
the patient is getting tube feeds via her ng tube of full strength jevity of ## cc per hour .
this is her goal .
she tolerates them very well and has approximately ### cc to ### cc of stool per day .
last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of ### cc to #### cc of liquid stool per day .
stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for c. difficile toxin .
these have all been negative .
we believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .
since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength nephro to jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .
she has been taking zantac , and the ph of her ng tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .
5. gu .
the patient has had hypernatremia .
she is approximately ## kg up her overall body weight .
we believe her to still be total body overloaded .
over the last several days , we have been giving her approximately ### cc to #### cc of free water through her ng tube .
we also have been diuresing her with bumex .
this seems to trend her sodium down .
this will need to be monitored closely .
her bun and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine .
6. heme .
as stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation .
she had an extensive workup by hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin .
before we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets .
she had no problems with this .
at the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the ## to ## range .
i stress that she cannot be anticoagulated .
we have given her lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed .
therefore , she is on no dvt prophylaxis .
she does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis .
she has a greenfield filter in place , and this is her only dvt prophylaxis .
7. id .
at the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection .
she is growing enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to macrodantin from her urine cultures .
interestingly enough , she also has enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum .
this is also sensitive only to macrodantin .
we do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time .
she is just begun on macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue ### mg per ng tube q.i.d. for a ten day course .
her foley was changed the day before discharge .
8. tubes , lines , and drains .
the patient has a tracheostomy , ng tube , and a foley catheter .
her central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge .
discharge medications :
albuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg q.4h. , please alternate albuterol and atrovent ; rocaltrol 0.## mcg per ng tube q.d.; calcium carbonate #### mg per ng tube q.i.d.; vitamin b## #### mcg im q. month , next dose is due nov ## ; diltiazem ## mg per ng tube t.i.d.; ferrous sulfate ### mg per ng t.i.d.; haldol 5 mg iv q.h.s.; hydralazine ## mg iv q.6h. p.r.n. hypertension ; lisinopril ## mg per ng tube q.d.; ativan 1 mg per ng tube q.h.s.; lopressor ## mg per ng tube t.i.d.; zantac ### mg per ng tube b.i.d.; multivitamin ## ml per ng tube q.d.; macrodantin ### mg per ng tube q.i.d. x ## days beginning on ##/3/## .

riie pruesschird is a ## year-old gentleman with metastatic angiosarcoma who presents as a transfer from nacalv medical center with a fever to ### , vomiting times one and "" left kidney pain "" .
this patient is an unfortunate young gentleman who was initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of #### after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of dep therapy for pulmonary involvement .
in the summer of #### he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation .
in early #### he underwent resection of this mass however in february of #### he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and adriamycin for six cycles .
in ##/## he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis .
in early #### he was started on therapy with taxol per dr. azel hibbskays and finished this in march of this year .
ct imaging at that time was negative for disease .
in april of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side .
thereafter he began chemotherapy with taxotere in ##/## and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on ##/##/## .
most recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the pointexasp region general hospital on ##/##/## .
that hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus .
he was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( tpa ) and was discharged on ##/##/## on high dose , low molecular weight heparin .
it was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization .
finally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to ### and was otherwise eventually discharged to pre health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation .

associated procedures :
##/##/## sternal debridement .
bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flap .
right superiorly based rectus abdominis flap .
primary closure of wound .
history and reason for hospitalization :
the patient is a ## year old gentleman with a history of an ascending aortic graft replacement in #### for aortic dissection .
at that time the patient 's hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap .
the patient was then continued by report on dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation .
the patient apparently did well until june #### when he noted a bulge in his sternal area .
a ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired .
the patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired .
however the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma .
by report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and pain control at the outside hospital .
however the patient was then subsequently transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital upon request of the family on 8/##/## for further evaluation and possible intervention .
the patient was evaluated by dr. rhalt of dentvailr. medical center .
as the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .
there was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .
at the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the infectious disease service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous unasyn to levofloxacin for what appeared to be citrobacter and diphtheroids in the wound cultures .
subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside .
given all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .
the patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .
the patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .
he did report a ## lbs weight loss over the last several months .

regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 diastolic ___ and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles .
extremities :
the patient had 2+ femoral pulses and 1+ pedal pulses .
laboratory and radiologic data :
sodium ### , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen ## , creatinine .9 , white blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit ##.7 , platelet count ### .
the patient 's preoperative chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis .
physical examination :
the patient 's sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed .
hospital course :
the patient was initially admitted to the cardiac surgical service under dr. rhalt .
the patient was admitted to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit given the patient 's precarious condition .
over the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier .
the patient was also seen in consultation by the infectious disease service as well as the cardiology service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension .
the patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the plastic surgical service for potential sternal reconstruction .
after lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft .
this was obtained on ##/##/## by dr. niste rhalt of the cardiac surgical service .
the patient was then subsequently taken to the operating room on ##/##/## with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection .
the procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest .
the aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein .
the cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and ## minutes .
the graft used was a homograft .
the patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit with his chest open .
the immediate postoperative plans were for a short intensive care unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum .
the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit in stable condition .
there he continued to be hemodynamically stable .
of note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent .
in the intensive care unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until ##/##/## which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .
on that day the plastic surgical service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .
the patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .
a number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .
the patient was then transferred back to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit in stable condition .
at this point the patient continued to followed by infectious disease service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included vancomycin and levofloxacin .
the operating room cultures at that point were positive for crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters .
over the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties .
the patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including lopressor ### mg po three times a day , captopril ### mg po three times a day , as well as procardia .
the patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control .
subsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the intensive care unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the cardiac surgical inpatient service .
the patient continued to be followed by the infectious disease service who felt that the patient 's jackson pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them .
as per the infectious disease service the patient was continued on levofloxacin , vancomycin as antibiotic coverage .
however on ##/##/## the infectious disease service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out mycoplasma humilius .
given this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of vancomycin and then subsequent levofloxacin for the citrobacter and mycoplasma as well .
the patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics .
this was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty .
at the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen .
he was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well .
he continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable .
on postoperative day no. ## the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the pip joint of his left middle finger .
subsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the plastic surgery hand service .
the patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .
the patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the plastic surgical service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .
these drains will then be subsequently taken out by dr. general upon his followup with the patient .
prior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .
the patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress .
as a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation .
the patient 's condition continued to be improved .
given this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on ##/##/#### .
in consultation with the infectious disease service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .
condition on discharge :
good .
discharge instructions :
diet :
high calorie , high protein .
the patient 's treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks .
the patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by occupational therapy services fairm of ijordcompmac hospital .
the patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger .
the patient on discharge is to have twice weekly vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term vancomycin therapy .
the patient was instructed to return to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema , drainage , or increasing incisional pain .
the patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills .
medications on discharge :
1. vancomycin ### mg intravenous q ##h.
2. levofloxacin ### mg po per day .
3. prilosec ## mg po per day .
4. captopril ### mg po three times a day .
5. lopressor ### mg po three times a day .
6. albuterol nebulizers q6h as needed .
7. atrovent nebulizers q6h as needed .
8. lasix ## mg po per day .
9. kay-ciel ## meq po per day .
followup :
the patient was instructed that he needed to followup with dr. rhalt by calling his office for appointment at ###-#### subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in oaksale lavalle .
the patient was also instructed to followup with dr. both of the cardiology service fairm of ijordcompmac hospital following his discharge so that his antihypertension medications could be appropriately adjusted .
the patient will also be seen in followup by dr. chpo e. enla general of the plastic surgery service fairm of ijordcompmac hospital so that his indwelling jackson pratt drains be appropriately management and if needed be discontinued by him .
the patient will also be followed by the infectious disease service so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy .
the patient was instructed to followup with dr. naco mesprhalt of the infectious disease service by calling her office for an appointment at ###-###-#### to be seen in approximately four weeks following the patient 's discharge .
dr. dau 's recommendation is that the patient is to stay on vancomycin and levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression .

principal diagnoses :
1 ) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .
2 ) bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
3 ) renal failure requiring chronic dialysis .
history of present illness :
the patient is a ## year-old woman transferred from pre health on june ## , #### to the verg medical center intensive care unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
on may ## , #### , the patient presented to pre health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung .
she was treated with clindamycin and erythromycin which were changed to trovan and then transferred to a hospital .
on may ## , #### , the patient desaturated to ##% with a temperature of ###.5 degrees .
her oxygen saturations improved to only ##% on ###% face mask and she was admitted to pre health intensive care unit .
chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion .
a vq scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of ##% .
on may ## , #### , the patient had a ct scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions .
at this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ana was 1:### and her rheumatoid factor and anca were negative .
she was started on a steroid trial at that point .
her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy .
on june ## , #### , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed .
the patient was then started on ## mg of prednisone q. day .
from may ## , #### through june ## , #### , the patient had a decline in her platelets from ### to ## with a stable hematocrit of ## to ## and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 .
on june ## , #### , she was transferred to the verg medical center medical intensive care unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .
past medical history :
1 ) cerebrovascular accident in #### in the pontine region secondary to hypertension .
2 ) hypertension .

allergies :
the patient had no known drug allergies .
social history :
the patient is divorced .
she has two children .
she recently retired as a clerical worker .
she denies any tobacco .
she has only social alcohol use .
family history :
father died at age ## of coronary artery disease .
mother died at age ## of pancreatic carcinoma .
brother has coronary artery disease .
there is no family history of hematologic problems .
laboratory :
laboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of ### , potassium 6.2 , bun ### , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count ## , hematocrit ## with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count ## and ldh ### .
hospital course :
1 ) bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia :
the video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
the patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay .
this was changed to solu-medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .
by discharge , she was returned to ## mg of prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .
the patient 's bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on july ## , #### , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .
repeat chest x-rays and chest ct scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient 's pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .
at the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid ##% .
2 ) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :
the patient was initially admitted with platelet count of ## , hematocrit of ## , ldh of ### with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear .
this was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on june ## , #### , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through july ## , #### .
she was also changed to intravenous solu-medrol ## mg q. day which was changed back to ## mg of prednisone prior to discharge .
her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of ### on july 3 , #### , then they steadily fell to a low of ## on july ## , #### .
her ldh which peaked at #### decreased to the mid ###s , but remained elevated .
she continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased .
the patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit .
eventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after july ## , #### .
after this , the patient 's platelet count rose to a maximum of ### on discharge .
it is felt that the patient 's thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved .
she will continue on her prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper .
3 ) renal :
the patient presented in acute renal failure with a bun of ### and a creatinine of 3.7 .
throughout the month of june , she had a rising potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on july ## , #### .
the opinion of the renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .
she required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .
during the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation .
4 ) infectious disease :
the patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on june ## , #### , july 4 , #### , july 8 , #### and july 9 , #### .
the patient eventually had a left subclavian tesio catheter placed and a right brachial picc line placed on july ## , #### which remained patent and uninfected .
she received a full three week course of vancomycin and also received a three week course of ceftazidime .
in addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received levofloxacin times fourteen days .
she also received a fourteen day course of acyclovir which was begun on june ## , #### for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus .
she was also on fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days .
the patient was also started on bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids .
5 ) rheumatology :
the patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ana of 1:### although her rheumatoid factor and anca were negative .
unfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange .
a repeat ana , rheumatoid factor and anca may be repeated as an outpatient .
follow-up :
1 ) the patient will follow-up with her primary care physician , dr. tamarg study , in arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation .
2 ) the patient is being discharged to a hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on monday , wednesday and friday .
the nephrologist who will follow her there is dr. study .
3 ) the patient will continue to have her cbc , ldh , bilirubin , chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to dr. ian zineisfreierm , the hematology attending at fax number ###-###-#### .
4 ) the patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula .
the left subclavian tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time .
she would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at pre health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this .
5 ) the patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below ## .
6 ) the patient will continue her prednisone at ## mg p.o. q. day times one month ( this was started on july ## , #### ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by pulmonary .

the lima to the lad was patent , but there was downstream ##% lesions at the apical portion of the lad .
the snake graft was open to the diagonal and to the first obtuse marginal branch , but was occluded to the second portion of this vessel .
for this reason , he had a second bypass operation on 5/5/#### by dr. riez .
he had a vein graft to the acute marginal of the right coronary artery in snake fashion to the terminal portion of the right coronary artery .
he had a vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal one and a vein graft on the lad bypassing the mid lesion .
the lima was left from the first surgery .
he did have transient atrial fibrillation after surgery .
he had chest pain and an abnormal stress test in #### and cardiac catheterization at that time on 8/##/#### showed that all the grafts were patent , but the runoff to the first diagonal for the vein graft was compromised and he had a 2.5 x ## mm s### stent placed at the ostium of the diagonal branch .

the lad was occluded and the lima to the proximal lad was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the lad and that was also patent .
the vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent .
the culprit territory was the distal left-sided pda coming off the circumflex and this had an ##% stenosis .

briefly , there is noted to be dense adhesions involving the ileum , the appendix , cecum , pelvic cystic mass and the right ovary .
in the course of lysis of adhesions a small enterotomy in ileum was noted .
general surgical consultation was obtained from dr. obe who performed lysis of ileal adhesions with another small enterotomy secondary to dense adhesions .
an approximately 3-4 cm segment of the ileum was resected with a primary end to end reanastomosis .
the estimated blood loss was ### ml .

other notalbe labs :
patient was found to have a troponin of 0.## on admission with a ck of ## and ckmb of 3.4 .
assessment :
at that time , it was felt that the patient was likely having a repeat gi bleed and while he was hemodynamically stable , he had evidently lost a substantial amount of blood .
hospital course :
1. gi :
patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight , the first night after admission and his hematocrit bumped up appropriately .
he remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission .
he was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and on iron sulfate and vitamin c .
his coumadin was held at the time given the bleeding , even though it was important to keep his inr 2.5-3.5 , given his artificial valve it was felt that the risk of continued bleeding was to great to continue the coumadin .
he was subsequently seen by the gi team who performed an upper endoscopy which demonstrated the following :
in the esophagus , there was a small hiatal hernia and in the stomach there is evidence of erosive gastritis of the body of the stomach and the antrum , the mucous appeared edematous .
a small polyp was found in the fundus which stigmata of old bleeding ; an endoclip was applied to this .
another polyp was found in the antrum and cold biopsies were obtained there .
in the duodenum , a small avm was noted in the second portion of the duodenum and was cauterized .
the biopsy subsequently demonstrated a hyperplastic polyp with acute and chronic inflammation and erosion and reactive epithelial changes but no dysplasia .
also of note , prior to the upper endoscopy , the patient received fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation .
patient remained hemodynamically stable during and after the upper endoscopy and his hematocrit remained above ## following this until the point of discharge .
his last recorded hematocrit on discharge was ##.3 .
his last bun and creatinine were ## and 1.5 with an inr of 2.5 .
consideration was given to performing a repeat colonoscopy .
this was discussed with the gi service who felt that this was not necessary given the recent colonoscopy that he had had in ##/#### .
2. cardiovascular :
a :
ischemia :
patient 's troponin bump was found to be likely to demand ischemia in the setting of his gi bleed , it was not felt that he was having acute coronary syndrome .
on discharge , he was continued on his aspirin , simvastatin and his lopressor which was initially held , and subsequently restarted .
b :
rhythm :
patient continued to be in a-fib. throughout the admission and was restarted on his coumadin concurrently with heparin .
heparin was subsequently dcd once his inr reached a therapeutic level between 2.5-3.5 .
his last reported inr on discharge was 2.5 .
c :
valves :
patient had , as noted above , his anticoagulation was initially reversed despite his having artificial valves .
however , his coumadin was subsequently restarted and he achieved therapeutic inr levels before discharge .
d :
pump :
patient , during this hospital course , became hypervolemic likely due to his diuretics being held and due to his receiving blood products .
he was diuresed initially with one dose of lasix and subsequently with one dose of torsemide after it was discovered that he developed thrombocytopenia on a prior admission in reaction to lasix .
he subsequently was diuresed to a euvolemic state .
of note , he did not become thrombocytopenic on this admission .
disposition :

the area of hemorrhage the same , slightly more edema and mass effect .
pulmonary angiogram :
no evidence of pulmonary emboli .
hospital course :
given the localization of the hematoma and the history of hypertension , the most likely cause for mrs. dua 's cerebellar hemorrhage is hypertension .

at the time of discharge , mrs. dua has had a remarkable recovery .
she is now able to walk fitfully and use her left hand with no problem .
the exam is remarkable for a mild leftsided face , arm and leg weakness and sensory deficit that should further improve with physical therapy and occupational therapy help .
she will be followed by the ot / pt dept. for that .
her hypertension was difficult to manage initially and required three days of intensive care unit with a-line and nipride intravenously .
it was finally under control with high doses of captopril , nifedipine , and hydrochlorothiazide .
the workup to rule out secondary cause of hypertension given the patient 's young age and the difficulty controlling the blood pressure was started as an inpatient and will be completed by dr. ______________as an outpatient .
so far no secondary causes of hypertension were identified but causes like lymphocytic ? chromocytoma or renal artery stenosis have not been ruled out yet .
medications on discharge :
hydrochlorothiazide ## mg. po q.day , captopril ## mg. po three times a day , nifedipine ## mg. po three times a day .

her cks and troponins were negative .
her beta hydroxybutyrate was 0.## .
her ua showed 3+ protein , 5-8 wbcs , 8-## rbcs , and 1+ bacteria .
hospital course by system :
this is a ##-year-old with a history of uncontrolled diabetes in the past , who presents with hhnk .
at the time , she was treated for such , including iv fluids and an insulin drip .
she recovered very nicely .
continued hospital course , she recovered well from her hhnk .
ortho-wise , emergent ortho consult decided that the right shoulder needed to be drained .
tap showed that she had an active infection , with ##### wbcs , ##### rbcs , including ##% polys , from the right shoulder .
therefore , she was thought to have right shoulder sepsis and was taken to the or emergently .
in the operating room , ##-## cc of pus was drained from the shoulder and a drain was placed .
she received iv fluids and had an estimated blood loss of #### cc .
the patient 's crit dropped from a baseline of ## to ## .
she was also not following commands and her glucose was ### .
she was then transferred to the medical intensive care unit .
in the medical intensive care unit on ##/##/## , the patient was recovering , with being able to follow commands .
she stayed in the intensive care unit until 1/5/## .
she was treated with nafcillin and gentamicin , also with vancomycin .
cultures still showed mssa .
hospital course during the micu stay was notable for a decreased hematocrit .
she received multiple units of blood for this .
also , she had decreased urine output , thought to be prerenal , and received large volume iv fluids .
she required small doses , a renal dose of dopa , to increase her urine output , and she did better .
she responded well and then the dopa was d / c'd on 1/4/## .
from the id perspective , the patient had a tte on ##/## that showed an ef of ##% , question of a mobile echodensity along the rv , but no proof of endocarditis .
this was significant in that the head ct done on 1/4/## to evaluate change in mental status revealed a new right parietal infarct that may represent septic emboli ; however , on further evaluation it was thought that this was most likely a stroke , not really just sepsis .
there was no recommendation for further workup .
she was transferred to the floor on 1/5/## , and by system :
1. id :
she was continued to be treated for mssa bacteremia and she should complete a 6 weeks course .
2. renal :
patient slowly improved with her creatinine on the day of admission , still continuing to improve .
secondary to all the iv fluids she received in the intensive care unit , the patient has been having a goal of -1 l / day , which we have been able to accomplish successfully on lasix ### mg p.o. b.i.d. , with extra doses of ## mg iv as needed .
3. cardiovascularly , patient , of note , had an ekg that had intermittent right bundle-branch block ; however , this recovered .
she does have known cad from previous echos .
she has been stable .
she is on a beta blocker .
her ace inhibitor had been held , but may be restarted as soon as her creatinine normalizes .
4. neurological :
her head ct showed a right parietal infarct .
patient should have an mri as an outpatient to follow up .
most likely represents an ischemic stroke .
workup for b## and rpr studies were all negative .
5. gi-wise , the patient had been started on tube feeds ; however , she recovered and ng tube was d / c'd and patient taking p.o.'s .
she was also started on lactulose to increase her bowel movements as needed .
her ammonia level is normalized .
6. heme-wise , her hematocrit remained stable .
7. endocrine-wise , her sugars have been much improved and she continues on her nph dose .
plan for the long term is that the patient will receive six weeks of iv antibiotics .
she will return to see dr. ayan koteskismanhout in orthopaedic surgery in ##-## weeks for evaluation of the right shoulder and aspiration .
if the aspirate is negative and overall health is good , then she will consider implantation of hemiarthroscopy ; for now , she needs to continue in the sling .
for access , the patient will have a picc line in order to continue iv fluids .
the discharge medications include albuterol nebulizer 2.5 q. 2 h. as needed , calcium carbonate #### b.i.d. , carbamazepine ### p.o. t.i.d. , lasix ### p.o. q. day , insulin sliding scale , lactulose ##-## ml p.o. q.i.d. as needed .
