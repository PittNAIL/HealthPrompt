Date :
03/24/1995
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. Tennis is a 65-year-old , white male , status post myocardial infarction x two , status post coronary artery bypass graft x three , with an ejection fraction of 20% on transplant workup , who presents with recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , and light-headedness .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history of myocardial infarction x two in 1984 and 1987 ( receiving tissue plasminogen activator in 1988 ) and subsequently was admitted to an outside hospital in 1992 with symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was admitted to the Utal Health in 12/92 for unstable angina and symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was hypotensive and intubated at that time and was subsequently stabilized .
Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 50% to 70% left main , 50% to 70% proximal left anterior descending , 70% to 80% mid-left anterior descending , 100% proximal left circumflex , and proximal and distal 50% right coronary artery lesions .
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25% .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x three by Dr. Kennedy with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to OM of the left circumflex .
The vein grafts were considered to be very close and of poor quality .
In the intervening period , he has had atrial fibrillation as his baseline rhythm which has been treated with Procainamide .
He has had numerous interval admissions to Shoreale Medical Health for congestive heart failure of an increasing pattern in 03/93 and 08/94 and then every three weeks since the beginning of the year .
He has had three-pillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and nocturia three to four times per night but no swelling and no weight gain ( although he has had four-inch increase in his abdominal girth in the past year ) .
His primary event complaints are episodes of shortness of breath with neck pain without radiation but with dizziness , light-headedness , pallor , and some chest pressure .
He often takes Nitroglycerin sublingual with relief of his chest pressure but no change in other symptoms .
He also complains of 30-yard dyspnea on exertion and one-block claudication .
He was recently seen in outpatient clinic by Dr. Carbon , where an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% , mid-septalapical distal lateral wall akinesis , 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation , and moderate left atrial enlargement .
His Procainamide was discontinued , and plans were made to start him on Amiodarone .
However , since the day prior to admission , he has had three episodes of shortness of breath with headache , diaphoresis , and pallor .
The night before admission , his blood pressure was 100/60 , and pulse was 76 .
He took Nitroglycerin x one with some relief of his shortness of breath but no change in his other symptoms .
The morning of admission , he had another episode with waves of nausea , dizziness , light-headedness , and pallor .
He came to the Emergency Room for evaluation .
In the Emergency Room , he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 to 150 and with a blood pressure of 124/84 and 98% O2 saturation .
He was admitted for diuresis for management of his arrhythmia .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Iron deficiency anemia .
Hypertension .
Urosepsis in 1982 .
Peptic ulcer disease , resulting in gastrectomy .
A 65% stenosis of his proximal right internal carotid artery in 12/92 .

Blood pressure was 154/90 in the right and 150/82 in the left .
Pulse was varying between 120 and 140 .
He was afebrile .
His respiratory rate was 20 .
Saturation was 98% in room air .
On HEENT exam , pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation .
Extraocular movements were intact .
He had a furrowed tongue , but hisoropharynx was otherwise negative .
He had no carotid bruits with good bilateral upstroke .
His JVP was difficult to assess with a questionable meniscus near the ear at 45 degrees .
Cardiac exam revealed an irregular rate .
The PMI was anteriorly displaced in the mid clavicular line with an anterior heave .
Heart sounds were distant and difficult to separate secondary to rate .
An S2 split was not appreciated .
There were no murmurs .
There was no apparent S3 .
Chest was clear to percussion and auscultation .
Abdomen was obese .
Abdominal exam revealed surgical scars and questionable hepatojugular reflux .
Liver was 10 cm. in width , 2 to 3 cm. below the rib .
Rectal exam was heme negative .
Extremities were warm with good distal pulses .
Neurologic exam was non focal .
Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact .
Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin were normal .

LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , hematocrit was 40 , white count 7.18 , platelets 250 , sodium 138 , potassium 4.2 , BUN 31 , creatinine 1.5 .
Digoxin level was 1.3 .
The INR was 2.5 , PTT 38.8 .
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM :
The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at 128 per minute with no detectable P-R interval , QRS of 0.09 , and QTC of 0.42 .
His axis was +50 degrees with an incomplete bundle branch block .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
In summary , he was found to have strong symptoms of congestive heart failure by history , which were consistent with a chronic picture and low ejection fraction .
He was planned for initial medical management with optimization of his cardioactive medications , loading on Amiodarone and diuresis .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was loaded on Amiodarone while under surveillance with cardiac monitor and was aggressively diuresed .
A right heart catheterization was performed , and a left heart catheterization was performed , which revealed a right atrial pressure of 10 , a right ventricular pressure of 60/10 , a pulmonary arterial pressure of 40 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 , a left ventricular pressure of 115/24 .
His left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to OM was not detected by the aortic root shot .
The ejection fraction was not calculated .
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed , and his medications were tailored over the course of the following 48 hours by following the appropriate parameters .
The Swan-Ganz catheter was subsequently removed , and his medications were continued to be tuned empirically .
During this time , he continued to complain of occasional chest pain which was variably relieved by sublingual Nitroglycerin , intravenous Metoprolol , and Morphine .
There were no EKG changes during these episodes .
On 3/22 , after an appropriate load of Amiodarone , he was successfully cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm , 100 , 200 , 360 , 360 .
There were no complications from this procedure , and he remained in normal sinus rhythm until the time of discharge .
He was reloaded back upon Coumadin and reached a therapeutic INR .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY
NAME :
KOTE , LYFRANKLAPALM
UNIT NUMBER :
512-13-39
ADMISSION DATE :
01/18/2001
DISCHARGE DATE :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 64 year old patient initially admitted to Dr. Riode Area status post an aorto bifemoral bypass in 01/98 with an end to end proximal and to the common femoral bilaterally .
The patient has had recurrent claudication for the last five months and has developed lesions on the first toe which is apparently similar to aparonychia .
He had an angiogram which shows a severe stenosis in the right distal area with a thrombosing right limb of an aorto femoral graft .
He also has an irregular lesion at the profunda femoris origin and with the superficial femoral occluded bilaterally .
He was therefore admitted to the hospital for an ileofemoral bypass .
The patient unfortunately continues to smoke and has greater than a 50 pack year history of smoking and by notes of Dr. Area 's office , this has been discussed at length with him and the implications of the smoking .
He has a history of a deep vein thrombosis and a question of a pulmonary embolism with what is thought to be a non fully documented hypercoagulable state .
He had a left superficial femoral artery interposition graft around 1990 which is non functioning at the present time , most of which was done at the Alconspore Woocawo Medical Center .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
His medications on admission include Coumadin and Levofloxacin .
His Coumadin has been held for two days .
His claudication is equal bilaterally .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination was remarkable for no carotid bruits , a ventral hernia without any masses which was reasonably reducible .
His rectal exam was refused at the time of surgery since apparently it was negative at the Tocon Hospital the previous week .
He has a first and fourth toe which had some purulent discharge around the toes with ischemic modeled toes and on the left side there were no lesions in the feet .
His pulse exam was a femoral pulse bilaterally , but none distally .
LABORATORY DATA :
His BUN and creatinine were within normal limits at 16 and 1.3 and his hematocrit was 44 with a white blood count of 10,000 and 139,000 platelet count .
He has ankle brachial indices of .36 bilaterally but with his right toes appearing ischemic with lesions he would most likely not heal these lesions .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Dr. Area had asked me to see the patient and after discussing with the patient it was agreed that I would proceed with revascularization of his right leg since he had a angiogram which demonstrated a failing limb of his aortofemoral graft and a tight profundus stenosis .
After discussing with the patient , getting his prothrombin time closer to range , he was brought to the operating room where a ileo profunda bypass was performed with an 8 mm .
EP to FE under general endotracheal anesthesia .
There was copious thrombus in the distal right limb of the aortofemoral graft which also had a thromboendarterectomy performed and excellent inflow was achieved .
Superficial femoral artery was divided since it was also chronically occluded .
There was a significant amount of thrombus at the anastomosis as well which had developed a small aneurysmaltype of dilatation , although there was no dehiscence of the anastomosis .
The profunda had been opened beyond the origin stenosis and the bypass was then performed providing and excellent flow to the calf and excellent pulsevolume recordings were obtained with strong upstrokes .
It was therefore elected not to proceed with a distal bypass graft to the popliteal arteries which would have been required should this not have worked .
The patient postoperatively did quite well .
He had continued good post volume recordings and there was no question that with this improved circulation and Silvadene dressings to his toes that they actually started to heal in his postoperative course with improved perfusion and capillary refill .
His groin incision was healing nicely and he was on Heparin , being converted to Coumadin .
Because of the issue relating to his hypercoagulable state , and the need for getting him in range , he was keptin the hospital and not discharged .
The orders of his wounds and wound care were clarified and he was transferred to Frontera 34 to ensure that this would be performed properly .
No cellulitis was present , and the patient had indicated his desire to be discharged .
Despite loading him on Coumadin , his prothrombin time and INR increased slowly and he left the hospital without discharge order or discharge planning on the 18th of December .
I had called the patient and discussed with him his care , which he had been then transferring to his local medical doctor for anticoagulation purposes .
I explained to the patient that because of his early discharge I would not be able to be responsible for his care but would be happy to see him in theoffice for removal of his sutures and an appointment for that was undertaken .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 66 year old white female with metastatic colon carcinoma with a mass in the left superhilar region , who presents for bronchoscopy , mediastinal exploration and resection .
The patient was in her usual state of health until she experienced the onset of abdominal pain in early 1992 .
In December of 1992 , she underwent a transverse colectomy for colon carcinoma which was Duke 's grade B-II , lymph nodes were negative .
She received postoperative chemotherapy .
In September of 1992 , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy because of an increased level of CEA in her blood with the presence of a liver abnormality on computerized tomography scan .
The exploratory laparotomy was negative .
She continued to have a rise in her CEA level which prompted a further work up .
In September of 1993 , an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was negative and in June of 1993 , she had a negative bone scan .
In December of 1994 , a thoracic computerized tomography scan showed a four centimeter soft tissue mass on the left suprahilar region , adjacent to the aortopulmonary window .
She also experienced increased hoarseness over the preceding months , which was due to left vocal cord paralysis .
She also complains of increased shortness of breath for the preceding month and now presents for mediastinal exploration and resection of her probable metastatic mass .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient has a history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , previous myocardial infarction in 1983 , hypothyroidism , history of breast cancer and history of colon cancer .

The patient was brought to the Operating Room on January 3 , 1994 where she underwent a median sternotomy with removal of her mediastinal mass .
This mass was situated in the aortopulmonary window and was sent to pathology .
The frozen section analysis revealed this to be adenocarcinoma , metastatic disease from the colon most likely .
She had a chest tube placed intraoperatively and another placed postoperatively in the recovery room , for what was presumed to be a left pleural effusion .
This tube drained only a small amount of fluid and it was likely that the effusion was made to look more severe in the presence of left hemidiaphragm elevation .
This additional chest tube was removed the following day .
Her postoperative hematocrit was 31 , compared to a preoperative level of 43 .
Her postoperative recovery was really quite remarkable .
Mediastinal chest tube was removed on postoperative day three .

Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
10-24-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
11-2-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Non-Q wave myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Status post anterior myocardial infarction in 05-93 , status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left anterior descending in 05-93 , hypertension , diabetes mellitus .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Coronary angiography , exercise tolerance test with Thallium .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Metoprolol 50 mg PO bid , Isordil 20 mg PO tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 PO qd .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .
He was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .
The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q's in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.
On physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .
The cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .
He had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .
He also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB's .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .
He had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .
On day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .
On day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .
Therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .
The patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .
However , he did not keep any of these appointments .
He went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .
On the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .
He was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
His cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
His past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
On admission , he was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .
HABITS :
The patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 .
The HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact .
The pupils equal , round , reactive to light .
The oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .
There were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .
The neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .
The carotids were 1+ without bruits .
The heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
The lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .
The abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .
The liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .
There was no splenomegaly .
The femoral pulses were diminished .
He had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .
The extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The pulses were 1+ bilaterally .
The skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .
The rectal examination was guaiac negative .
LABORATORY DATA :
The laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 .
The portable chest X-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .
The electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .
He was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .
No beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .
This was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA 'd , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .
The left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .
Given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .
He was ambulated progressively on the floor .
A beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .
The patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .
On 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .
This treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .
The patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .
There were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .
The study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .
Thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .
There was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .
These images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .
After extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .
The patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .
Dr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance .
Previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .
The importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .
She will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .
The patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .
Despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .
He will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .

DISCHARGE DATE :
8/9/93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Acute myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Lower gastrointestinal bleed .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male whose cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , tobacco use and a positive family history .
He was a previously healthy male who reports a pattern of intermittent chest pain during the week prior to admission .
On the night prior to admission he was awakened from sleep with severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm , accompanied by back pain at about 9:30 p.m.
He was taken to the Pre Health emergency room and at about 2:45 a.m. on 7/30 an electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm ST elevations in leads V1 to V4 and 2 mm ST elevations in lead V5 .
He was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine .
He was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital hemodynamically stable .
HE arrived in the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120/80 , heart rate 90 .
An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions .
It was notable for 4 to 7 mm ST elevations throughout the precordium with Qs in leads V1 and V2 , with 2 mm ST elevations in aVL and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aVF .
The initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum .
He was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , Ativan and a LIdocaine drip .
Because of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable only for surgical repair of an ulcer and a remote appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None
ALLERGIES :
Penicillin , which gives him a rash .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
His habits include smoking one pack per day for many years and moderate to heavy alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an elderly appearing male in no significant distress .
His pulse was 84 and regular , blood pressure 114/70 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
The neck was supple .
The carotids were of normal amplitude without bruits .
On cardiac examination he had a nonpalpable left ventricular impulse , a quiet S1 and S2 , no murmurs .
He had an audible S3 and a jugular venous pressure of 8 .
On lung examination he had rales one third up bilaterally .
His abdomen was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly , no guarding and no rebound .
On rectal examination he had bright red blood in the vault without any stool .
His extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
The hematocrit was 44.9 , white blood count 14.3 , platelet count 301,000 , sodium 138 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 102 , CO2 27.4 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 147 .
The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 , left atrial enlargement , ST elevations in V4 through V6 , I and aVL , consistent with acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with Q waves in V1 to V3 and reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aFV .
The chest X-ray showed a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29/16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 .
He had a proximal 95% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal .
The left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30% residual stenosis .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically .
The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the MICU .
On hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned .
The patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra-aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with Serax .
The Lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well .
On the third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed .
The intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off .
After removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated .
On the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor .
However , after a single dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient 's blood pressure dropped to the 60/40 range and he was therefore kept in the MICU .
The peak CPK level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7% MB fraction .
On the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor .
Once on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain .
An echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44% .
On transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool .
He was evaluated by the GI Service who felt that , given the patient 's course , he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future .
The patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day .
He exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80% of the maximal heart rate on the modified Bruce protocol .
He did not have chest pain .
There were ST and T wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery .
The thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution .
Based on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel .
These findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin .
Because of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100/70 , an ACE inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued .
The patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for acute and chronic respiratory distress with likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and question of a pulmonary embolus .
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial CK 's which were normal .
Echocardiogram was obtained which showed normal left ventricle , a dilated right ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis .
The RVSP was estimated at 35 .
Echocardiogram findings with persistent , profound right heart failure .
The patient subsequently underwent a pulmonary arteriogram which revealed no pulmonary emboli , but pulmonary artery pressure of 39/22 , wedge pressure of 12 and a right atrial pressure of 10 .
The patient also had mild liver function test abnormalities , for which she underwent right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed patent portal vein , patent hepatic vein and artery and bilateral small pleural effusions with a 4 cm. complex cystic lesion with calcified walls on the lateral aspect of the spleen .

Pulmonary status stabilized , with the patient 's room air sat hovering around 90% .
Microbiologic work up for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare exacerbation was subsequently negative .
The patient remained cardiovascularly stable but unclear etiology of her subtle electrocardiogram changes and respiratory distress .
It was subsequently felt after full work up with a negative PA gram , plus / minus VQ , negative echocardiogram , negative sero-CK 's and no evolving electrocardiogram that the patient had pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic lung disease .
It was felt that the patient likely had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of greater severity and duration than initially suspected and by history from the patient , in particular supported by her chronic CO2 retention on subsequent arterial blood gases .
The patient was maintained on treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation , including steroid taper and nebs as well as antibiotic coverage .
Repeat chest x-ray subsequently showed hyperinflation consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , no signs of pneumonia or pulmonary edema , bilateral blunting of the costophrenic angles , consistent with pleural thickening , and / or small bilateral pleural effusions , consistent with right upper quadrant ultrasound .

The pylorus was entered and the first and second portion of the duodenum were inspected and were seen to be normal .
The scope was retroflexed in the antrum where it showed a normal fundus of the stomach and normal esophagogastric junction .
It was felt the patient 's GI bleeding was secondary to his previously known esophageal tear .
He was readmitted to the Coronary Care Unit on the 25th , where initially he was stable .
His aspirin was discontinued .
He was continued on the intravenous Cimetidine and Carafate except that he was made NPO .
He was transfused to keep hematocrit greater than 30 .
He was seen in consultation by the OLH Service , who felt he was a candidate for total parenteral nutrition .
On the 25th he developed progressive hypotension with evidence of further upper gastrointestinal bleeding .
He was intubated for airway protection .
An electrocardiogram at that time showed a right rate related right bundle and apical ST changes consistent with ischemia .
Repeat endoscopy was unsuccessful because of severe bleeding despite massive lavage .
A pneumothorax was noted on his chest X-ray on the 25th and a chest tube was placed .
On the 26th , because of continued massive bleeding , he was taken by Vascular Radiology for a question of embolization .
Three sites of active extravasation were found , one from the gastroesophageal junction area and two from the gastric fundus .
All sites were successfully embolized with Gelfoam with non-selective arterial embolization of the spleen occurring as well .
No varices were noted .
Severe right external iliac stenosis was noted .
The patient returned to the floor on the 26th with improved hemodynamics .
He was continued to be managed with packed red blood cells , platelets and fresh frozen plasma .
He was continued to be intubated with poor mental status .
He was paralyzed for the vascular procedure .
A head computerized tomography scan on the 26th showed a probable right cerebellar infarct and a question of a right middle cerebral artery infarct .
Given the multi organ system failure on the 26th the family was consulted regarding his dismal prognosis and they decided to make the patient do not resuscitate without further pressures or aggressive measures with comfort care being paramount .
The patient continued to have bleeding with progressive downward deterioration of his mental status and renal failure and temperature spikes .
The patient died on the 31st .
No cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed as per the patient and family wishes .

PLAN :
On admission , the patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with progressive supranuclear palsy who presents with painless jaundice and concerning abdominal CT scan findings .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient received a biopsy of the stomach lining on June 12 , 2005 .
This was read as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma , signet ring cell type with focal intestinal metaplasia that was read by the Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center pathologist .
At this point , Oncology consultation was obtained .
This disease does carry a morbid prognosis and given the patient 's poor functional status at baseline , a family meeting was convened on 6-14-05 with his wife , himself , Oncology personnel , Palliative Care physicians as well as the primary care team , Kymleen Nickju Freierm
It was decided to make the patient comfortable during this meeting .
This means that he is not to receive chemotherapy of any type including palliative chemotherapy .
Also Gastroenterology consultation did not recommend stent placement as there was no focal stenosis that could be intervened upon .
During this meeting , he was made do not resuscitate / do not intubate and he is to be discharged to the Hend Geadcoastcar Hospital where the emphasis should be entirely on this patient 's comfort ; that is antiemetics as he needs , pain control as needed and nutrition for his comfort .
Any additional medical care is not what the patient wants and he should not be readmitted to a medical facility .
His medications on discharge are to be prescribed by the Abradlishore Hospital here and are currently pending at the time of this dictation .
They will be added to this discharge summary .

The patient continued on hemodialysis .
He was seen by Interventional NeuroRadiology who recommended a CTA to better visualize question of left ICA stenosis .
CTA revealed patent ACA 's with dominant left A1 segment , hypoplastic right A1 segment but good filling of anterior cerebrals bilaterally .
It did show stenosis of the left carotid proximal to the cavernous portion .
However it did show contrast throughout .
It was thought by NeuroRadiology that this lesion given its proximity to the petrous portion in bone would not be amenable to stenting .
Given the embolic appearance of the stroke the patient was changed from heparin to Plavix and aspirin for anticoagulation .
He was not placed on Coumadin given discussion with his primary care doctor and history of multiple GI bleeds on aspirin alone .
2. Renal :
He contined on hemodialysis and was started on Renogel and Nephrocaps for high phosphorus levels .

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
magnetic resonance imaging of the brain on 10/18/96 .
THER PROCEDURES :
arterial catheterization on 10/14/96 , head CT scan on 10/14/96
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
Granrivern Call is a 79-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home .
His family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson 's disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .
This was poorly responsive to Eldopa .
He was later seen by Dr. Flo Cuchkote at the Ph University Of Medical Center and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .
Over the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .
He also developed a urinary incontinence .
He had had two falls to his wife 's recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .
On the morning of admission at 8 o'clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking "" gibberish "" .
He was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m.
There was no definite clonic activity .
There was no known incontinence .
He was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .
A trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .

There was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
vital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular .
He was afebrile .
In general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face .
head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated .
His neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits .
oropharynx was intubated with blood as well .

Cardiovascular examination ; regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
Abdominal examination ; soft , non-tender , non-distended , normal active bowel sounds .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .
Neurologically ; he opens his eyes to voice .
He does not regard the examiner .
He had no blink to threat .
His pupils were three down to two on the right and five down to four on the left .
According to the family this iansicoria was old .
He had intact corneals bilaterally and intact horizontal dull movements bilaterally .
He had left greater than right nasal stimulation to grimace .
He had no gag to tube manipulation .
Motor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands .
He triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to pain .
His deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right brachial radialis and right patella ; everywhere else his reflexes were 1 .
His toes were down going .
SUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :
sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , PO2 377 , PCO2 32 , PH 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , INR 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .
chest x-ray clear .
electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .
Head CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .
There was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1) NEUROLOGY :
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .
He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .
It did , however , show diffuse slowing .
He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .
His hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .
He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .
He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .
His diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .
It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .
It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson 's disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .
He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on October 18 , 1996 .
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .
In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .
However , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .
The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .
He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .
That was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small "" leaflet "" .
He remained chest pain free throughout his admission .
3) PULMONARY :
After his initial intubation he remained quite stable .
He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .
However , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .
4) HEMATOLOGY :
He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .
His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .
It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .
He did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .
It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .
5) GASTROINTESTINAL :
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the Ph University Of Medical Center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .
Thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on October 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .
In discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .
However , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .
The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DOCTOR 'S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary .
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Ria in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
The patient is a 55 year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest 02/04/94 .
She was transferred to Retelk County Medical Center for further therapy , and transplant evaluation .
Patient also received AICD .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .
Patient 's past medical history is to besummarized as follows :
In 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in Hispit , Delaware .
Since that time the patient has been treated medically .
In 07/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a MBO2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram .
On 09/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at Retelk County Medical Center .
Echocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .
Consequently the patient was started on Coumadin .
Catheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of 387 .
Coronaries were completely normal .
Consequently the patient was admitted to the CCU for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction .
In the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil .
Hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a SVR of 1300 and a wedge of 16 .
Pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% .
Repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .
Furthermore , due to the patient 's long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .
Consequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers .
The patient did well at home until 1/31/94 when she was admitted to Souland in Nixmont Bovo with increasing congestive heart failure .
At that time the patient was aggressively diuresed .
By report , in the interim since discharge from Retelk County Medical Center , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .
Dring this hospitalization at Hahkellrick Hospital , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest .
She was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block .
She was treated for a short time with Lidocaine and eventually weaned off .
She was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to Retelk County Medical Center for further evaluation .
The patient was transferred to Retelk County Medical Center on 02/20/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .
The patient was evaluated by the CHF and Heart Transplant Service .
It was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .
Furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the Alllo Eino Hospital which recommended EPS to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient 's arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative .
Note , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient 's hospitalization without difficulty .
On 02/22/94 an EPS study was performed .
The patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation .
Consequently AICD placement was recommended .
Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on 03/09/94 .
Note , from 02/22 to 03/09 there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis .
Consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the AICD .
Note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .
Cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement .
Thus , AICD placement was performed on 03/09/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .
There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the AICD placement .
By 03/10/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site .
At this point it was felt the patient would go home on 03/13/94 .
It was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to Vonamemp , LA via plane by herself .
This was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B Team .

The patient is a 40 year old male with a history of prior anterior myocardial infarction and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus who was transferred from an outside hospital after an episode of acute shortness of breath and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history four years ago of being admitted to the Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital after suffering an acute anterior myocardial infarction .
The course had multiple complications requiring pressors .
He had a cardiac catheterization performed which revealed a three vessel coronary artery disease with an occluded RCA , 70%-80% proximal LAD , and a high grade left circumflex lesion after the OM with distal left circumflex occlusion .
The patient was subsequently medically management after this hospitalization and has done very well .
His most recent echocardiogram in April of 1996 showed an ejection fraction of 20% with a thin fibrotic septum with akinesis and moderately severe hypokinesis in all other regions except for the lateral wall .
The patient also had an electrocardiogram in April of 1996 which was negative following , however was at a low workload .
The patient 's was most recently admitted to Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center on Martin Luther King Day after becoming acutely short of breath after a five minute walk .
He had no chest pain , palpitations , diaphoresis , or nausea .
He called the EMT 's and was found to be in pulmonary edema by chest x-ray at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center .
He was diuresed and ruled out for myocardial infarction .
His ECG showed no ischemic changes .
He was then transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
(1) Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus x 15 years with no retinopathy or foot lesions .

Urinalysis was negative .
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 63 with normal intervals .
He had flat T waves in I and aVL , which were unchanged from previous ECG .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for further management of his pulmonary edema .
It was felt that the patient possibly had a worsening of his coronary artery disease and therefore underwent cardiac catheterization on 01/17/96 .
At cardiac catheterization he had an RA pressure of 8 , an RV pressure of 52/10 , PA pressure of 60/25 , and wedge of 26 .

EKG showed question of MAT vs. atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 118 , axis was 0 degrees .
There was ST scooping in the lateral leads consistent with Dig vs. a question of chronic ischemia changes .
There was no significant change from his baseline EKG .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and placed in isolation on neutropenic precautions .
He was transfused with 1/2 units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix periodically to prevent him from going into congestive heart failure has he had on his prior transfusion .
Because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated Leuco four units .
The patient had a good bump in his hematocrit , more than expected from 22 to high 20 's range next day after 3 1/2 units , but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1/2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells .
He again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high 20 's after a total of 4 units , so he was given 2 more total units in 1/2 units segments the following day .
His hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than 30 and was discharged with hematocrit of 32 on 11-7-93 .
The patient remained asymptomatic from a CHF stand point and felt much better after the transfusions .
It is unclear why the patient did not bump his hematocrit more but he did not appear to be hemolyzing from laboratory data , that is his LDH was within normal limits .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Colitis .
The patient has a history of ischemic bowel status post SMA Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty with recent admission for gram negative rod urosepsis complicated by C. difficile colitis .
The patient received a full course of Flagyl and was C. difficile toxin negative times three prior to transfer .
He now returns with fever , rising white count , diarrhea , and dehydration .
Initially treated with intravenous ceftizoxime , gentamicin , and Flagyl for presumed sepsis , either with urine or bowel source .
He was also started on p.o. Vancomycin .
Blood cultures and urine cultures came back negative .
Stool for C. difficile returned positive .
The diagnosis , therefore , was relapsed C. difficile colitis .
Intravenous antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was continued on p.o. Vancomycin .
He improved clinically with defervescence , decreased white blood cell count to 10,000 with resolution of left shift , and some decrease in abdominal distention on exam .
An abdominal CAT scan revealed thickened bowel wall and thumb printing , primarily involving the cecum and right colon greater than the left , consistent with C. difficile colitis .
The diagnosis of recurrent bowel ischemia , however , was not ruled out and this will continue to be a concern in the future .
The patient was initially n.p.o. and was then advanced to clear liquids which he tolerated .
He will be advanced to soft solids prior to discharge .
2. Azotemia .
The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.8-2 .
Creatinine had risen to 4.3 on admission presumed secondary to sepsis and dehydration .
With intravenous hydration the BUN and creatinine fell to 12/1.9 which is within normal limits for this patient .
The abdominal CAT scan showed no evidence of hydronephrosis orrenal abscess .
3. Mental status .
The patient was alert and oriented throughout the admission ; however , by personality , he is somewhat cantankerous and demanding of the nurses .

Her sclera were nonicteric .
Her oropharynx was clear .
Her neck was supple without masses or bruits noted .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Her cardiac examination was unremarkable .
Examination of her abdomen revealed a flat nontender abdomen without palpable masses .
There were multiple well healed surgical scars .
She was guaiac negative .
There was no cva tenderness or spinal tenderness noted .
Her pulses were intact throughout .
LABORATORY DATA :

Her hematocrit was 37.2 with a white blood count of 6.6 .
Her Bilirubin direct and total were 0.1 and 0.3 respectively .
Her alkaline phosphatase was 134 .
Her electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm without acute ischemic changes .
Chest X-Ray was unremarkable .
The assessment at the time of admission was that of an 86 year old female with poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma , admitted for resection .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Service of Dr. Fede A. Duhenile .
On 1/12/92 she was taken to the operating room where she underwent a neart total gastrectomy with a retrocolic Bill-Roth II gastrojejunostomy reconstruction .
In addition a small ventral hernia was noted upon abdominal exploration within a previous surgical incision .
This was repaired .
A needle jejunostomy catheter was placed at the time of her operation to facilitate postoperative nutrition .
With regards to the cancer , there was a large mass along the greater curvature in the body of the stomach , and several perigastric lymph nodes which were taken with the specimen .
In addition , there were at least two lymph nodes within the porta hepatis which were dissected free and taken en bloc with the specimen .
The remainder of her abdomen was unremarkable without evidence of metastatic spread elsewhere , including the liver .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in good condition .
The patient 's postoperative course was for the most part unremarkable .
Her wounds healed well without incident and the needle jejunostomy tube was utilized on the first postoperative day right up until the time of discharge , infusing Vivonex T.E.N.
The patient tolerated this without difficulty .
The patient 's nasogastric tube was removed on the 3rd postoperative day , and with the passage of flatus and good bowel sounds noted , she was started on a liquid diet which was advanced slowly .
She was seen by the dietician and was advised with regard to needing numerous small meals during the day rather than 3 larger meals as she previously was used to .
Her ambulation and mobilization increased gradually and by the time of discharge she was walking in the halls without assistance .
As mentioned , her wounds healed well without incident and the staples were removed on the 10th postoperative day just prior to discharge .
She had some difficulties with confusion in the early postoperative period which were attributable to her advanced age and a sundowning effect .
These problems resolved by the 4th or 5th postoperative day and she remained lucid and alert for the remainder of her hospital stay .
Surgical pathology report was completed prior to discharge which revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma ulcerating and extending through the wall into the serosa of the stomach .
Metastatic carcinoma was present in 3 of 3 lymph nodes .
The gastric resection margins were free of carcinoma .
The patient was set for discharge on the 11th postoperative day doing well .
On the day prior to discharge she complained of some dysuria , a urine specimen was obtained , which showed numerous white cells consistent with a urinary tract infection .
She was started empirically on Bactrim , while culture and sensitivity results were pending and remained pending at the time of this dictation .
She will be discharged to home and will be seen in follow-up by her regular physicians as well as Dr. Ko .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Bactrim , single strength , one p.o. b.i.d. times 10 days , initiated 9/27/92 , Synthroid 0.1 mg p.o. q.day , Ferrous Gluconate 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Folate 1 mg p.o. q. day .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Pauci May is a sixty three year old patient referred by Dr. Laymie Aslinke for significant coronary artery disease .
He developed acute pulmonary edema on May 27 , 1993 , and was admitted to Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital , and found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation .
He denied any angina .
He had a gaited cardiac blood pool scan that showed an ejection fraction of 31% .
His pulmonary function tests showed FEV1 of 2.1 , and he was found to have intermittent obstructive sleep apnea .
An echocardiogram showed a dilated left atrium with mitral anular calcification .
He was discharged home but readmitted on May 21 with recurrent congestive heart failure .
A Thallium Stress Test showed equivocal ST segment changes with fixed apical and inferior defects .
His coronary risk factors include cigarette smoking , obesity , a family history of coronary disease , and elevated serum cholesterol .
He also has a history of atrial fibrillation with sinus pauses during sleep apnea .
On June 4 , 1993 , he underwent cardiac catheterization .
He was found to have an occluded right coronary artery , 70% distal left main lesion , 80% proximal ramus lesion , and his left ventricular ejection shows preserved function except for akinesis of the inferior wall .
His ejection fraction was 50% , a carotid duplex study showed plaqueing but no critical lesions .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
He has a wife Pandeprob and lives in Ashing .
He did smoke up to three pack per day .
He has three children .
He is retired .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Six foot , 250 pounds .
He is a well appearing male , in no distress .
HIs blood pressure was 140/70 , pulse 80 and irregular .
His neck veins were not distended .
His carotids showed bilateral bruits .
His lungs are clear .
His cardiac exam shows a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
His abdomen is obese , but benign .
His peripheral pulses are intact .
He has no peripheral edema .
His Neurological exam is nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
sodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 104 , CO2 30 , calcium 9.3 , phosphorous 1.2 , BUN 9 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 183 .
Uric acid 8.4 , bilirubin 0.7 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , amylase 46 , SGOT 20 , and his Digoxin level was 1.0 .
hematocrit 38% , white blood cell count 7700 , MCV 86 , PT and PTT were normal .
urinalysis was unremarkable .
His chest X-ray was normal with bilateral pleural thickening .
His electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation .
There were nonspecific ST and T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Hellworthston Hospital .
There , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by Cardiology and Anesthesiology .
There was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed .
On June 24 , 1993 , Dr. Lenni Breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery .
He placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow .
He weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass .
He had no hemodynamic difficulties .
He was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout .
He did revert back to atrial fibrillation .
He was extubated within forty eight hours .
He was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on June 26 .
He reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required Digoxin , and Verapamil to control .
He could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of Quinaglute .
He also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service .
He was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him .
Weight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease .
He was treated with Digoxin and Diuretics along with Ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function .
He was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation .
It was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis .
Primary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction .
He will be followed closely in 23 Hwy , Hamp by Dr. Laymie Aslinke .

5/13/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
5/16/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Hypopharyngeal cancer .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Removal of left neck lymph node and esophageal endoscopy and dilation .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This is a 69 year-old white male status post surgery in July of 1993 for a laryngopharyngoesophagogastrectomy with gastric reconstruction and modified right neck dissection for pharyngeal cancer .
Since that surgery , the patient has had dysphagia off and on , solids worse than liquids .
Sometimes solids get stuck for about 10 minutes .
About two months ago the patient had come to the emergency room because he couldn 't swallow for three days .
He required esophageal dilation .
Also , since July the patient has noted bilateral lymphadenopathy , especially the large submandibular , which has gotten larger .
It is difficult to get an exact history as to the onset of the lymphadenopathy , as the patient cannot vocalize and is intoxicated at the time of admission .
The lymphadenopathy is uncomfortable but not painful .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for radiation therapy after his surgery in July , a tracheoesophageal fistula , which was repaired , exploratory laparotomy in November , 1994 , for small bowel obstruction , hypertension , colitis , neonatal jaundice , and on September 1 , 1993 , drainage of a neck abscess .
He underwent closure of pharyngeal cutaneous fistula with muscle interposition on November 5 , 1994 , and a left upper lobectomy in September , 1993 , for lung cancer .
ALLERGIES :
Aspirin .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Notable for heavy alcohol use and history of heavy tobacco use , although he quit two years ago .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
No fevers or chills , no nightsweats .
Positive weight gain since his last admission , positive diarrhea times two weeks-soft brown stools .
Negative bright red blood per rectum , negative coughing , negative hemoptysis , negative hematemesis , negative chest pain , positive shortness of breath with exertion .
The patient can walk or go up a flight of stairs without any shortness of breath , however .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a pleasant , mildly intoxicated male with grossly swollen neck .
He was afebrile with stable vital signs .
Head , eyes , ears , nose , throat :
normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , regular and reactive to light and accommodation , extra ocular muscles intact .
Tongue with multiple white-yellow lesions .
Neck grossly swollen at the midline and right angle with jaw , unable to fully swallow .
The lungs were clear to auscultation .
Heart :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds .
Extremities without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
This 69 year-old male status post laryngopharyngo-esophagogastrectomy for cancer in 05/93 now represents with progressive dysphagia and gross lymphadenopathy and neck mass .
The patient is mildly intoxicated .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was given overnight hydration .
He was taken to the operating room on May 14 , 1994 , for a bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy , dilatation and biopsy .
His left neck mass was excised and preliminarily was said to be squamous cell carcinoma .
The patient had esophagoscopy , where a stenosis was noted which was dilated to a # 49 French catheter .
There were no complications .
The patient was taken to the floor in stable condition .
Postoperatively , there was no crepitus and X-rays showed no mediastinal air .
Neck biopsy site was clean .
On May 15 , the patient 's diet was advanced to a soft diet and then later in the day to a regular diet .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Breunlinke is a 70-year-old patient of Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in California .
She is referred for progressive angina .
She had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing .
She has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 .
In 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded .
In October , 1989 , Dr. No re-did her bypass operation .
She had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 .
In 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block .
She had exertional angina at that time .
In November , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft .
She had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis .
Since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin .
She was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
Because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here .
In May , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic .
She had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect .
She has had no syncope .
Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol .
She has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction .
She is a remote cigarette smoker .
She also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages .
She has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from Palmci
She lives alone .
Her son , Nertland is nearby and he works at the Em Nysonken Medical Center on Verville .
They live in Ohio .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds .
Her blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular .
Neck veins are not distended .
Respiratory rate 12 .
Carotids :
no bruits .
Lungs were clear .
Cardiac :
1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
Abdomen was benign .
Peripheral pulses intact .
Neurological examination non-focal .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing .
Hematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , PT and PTT normal .
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.0 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .
There , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 .
Her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .
She had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .
Her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .
The saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .
The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .
The saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .
This was considered her culprit lesion .
This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .
In addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .
Her left internal mammary artery was also unused .
It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .
She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .
This was intermittent .
The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .
The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .
It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .
Her pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .
She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .
When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .
Carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .
He felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .
For this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .
On August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .
There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .
It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .
She tolerated this well .
Her medications were resumed .
She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase , KS .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
RIGHT BREAST CARCINOMA , STATUS POST HIGH DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY AND AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL RESCUE .
LIST OF SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS :
( 1 ) High risk carcinoma of the right breast .
( 2 ) Hypertension .
( 3 ) Hypothyroidism .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. A is a 48-year-old woman , who was diagnosed with breast cancer in May of 1998 .
She was in her usual state of health until May of 1997 , when her right breast was noted to be abnormal on mammography .
Biopsy of this specific area was negative .
Subsequent mammography was , reportedly , benign and without significant interval change .
However , by May 1998 , she had appreciated a fullness in the right breast , and noted the emergence of a mass , which increased in size over time .
Mammography was repeated , which was highly suspicious for malignancy .
An ultrasound of the lesion was similarly suspicious for neoplasm .
The patient , therefore , went to incisional biopsy , which confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma .
She , subsequently , underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection ( November 1998 ) .
The final results from pathology revealed a very large tumor measuring 14 centimeters in size permeating the whole breast with a positive deep margin .
The tumor was described as histologically nuclear grade III with extensive lymphatic vascular invasion .
ER and PR were strongly positive , although , a K-617 index was unfavorable at 30 percent with a high esterase .
DNA content was deployed .
On examination of the lymph nodes , 22 of 24 lymph nodes sampled were involved with carcinoma .
Subsequent to surgery , she had an uncomplicated recovery .
She then went on to dose-intensive Adriamycin and tolerated this procedure remarkably well .
Restaging revealed no evidence of interval progression and the patient , therefore , went on to high-dose cyclophosphamide for stem cell mobilization .
Leukophoresis went well and stem cell yields were excellent .
Therefore , she is being admitted for intensification with high-dose cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin followed by stem cell rescue .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital , on the Neurological Surgery Service of Lupevickette L. Ca , M.D.
Prior to his admission , the patient 's gunshot wound was sutured close in the emergency room .
The patient was placed on suicide precautions , and was hydrated with an infusion of intravenous fluid .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Psychiatry Service , who began a battery of testing , which continues at the time of discharge .
The Consulting Psychiatrist recommended a minimum of 2 point restraints at all times , and recommended the patient be monitored by a sitter .
Allowing the patient to ambulate was not recommended .
From a medical standpoint , the patient did well .
He was initially admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored during the first two days of his hospitalization .
The chief obstacle was bringing his blood pressure under control and this was ultimately achieved with a combination of Captopril and Nifedipine .
After his blood pressure had stabilized , the patient was transferred to the Neurology Ward .
Close monitoring demonstrated his blood pressure to be stable and within an acceptable rang on his dosage regimen .
The Psychiatry Service followed up extensively with the patient , and his Psychiatric progress is detailed in the Psychiatry transfer note .
By the 7th hospital day , the patient was medically stable .
He had undergone full Psychiatric evaluation , and was prepared for transfer to a Psychiatric Hospital .

The ovaries were not seen on the abdominal ultrasound .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Cardiac :
The patient had no prior history of cardiac disease .
Although the chest pain that she had could have represented ischemia , there was a low clinical suspicion for this .
It was most likely felt that the patient 's chest pain was reflective of her abdominal gastroenteritis .
However , she was admitted to a cardiac floor and put on telemetry and a myocardial infarction was ruled out by serial CK 's .
The patient 's CK's were 233 , 198 and 132 .
Electrophoresis of the A set revealed no MB's .
The patient 's EKG did not evolve .
The patient has a long history of hypertension which has not been treated .
During this admission , she was started on nifedipine for control of her blood pressure .
GI :
The patient presented with diffuse abdominal pain which was more pronounced in the left lower quadrant , nausea and vomiting .
The differential diagnosis for this was felt to be a viral gastroenteritis , diverticulitis , degenerating fibroid , ovarian torsion and pelvic inflammatory disease .
Although the patient had cervical motion tenderness on admission physical exam , the gynecology service felt that the pelvic inflammatory disease was an unlikely diagnosis in this setting because the patient has had a tubal ligation in the past .
The patient had an abdominal and pelvic CT scan at which time the ovaries were identified and were felt to be unremarkable .
Additionally , the uterus itself was felt to be normal .
No diverticula were seen on the CT scan and no abscess was seen .
After receiving 24 hours of IV fluids and hydration , the patient 's abdominal symptoms spontaneously resolved .
She was taking po 's very well and had no further episodes of nausea , vomiting or emesis .
At the time of discharge , she still had mild left lower quadrant pain on deep palpation only .
Infectious disease :
At the time of admisison , the patient was afebrile and did not have a leukocytosis .
However , blood cultures were drawn on admission .
The patient had a total of four sets of blood cultures drawn .
One set of blood cultures grew out Group B strep and staph epi .
As the patient was afebrile and had a normal white blood cell count , it was suspected that these cultures results were most likely a contaminant .
Two additional sets of blood cultures were drawn and the patient was empirically started on vancomycin and Flagyl .
After 48 hours , all other blood cultures remained negative and the patient continued to be afebrile .
The antibiotics were discontinued , she was observed and remained afebrile .
Gynecologic :
The patient had perimenopausal symptoms at the time of admission with hot flashes and irregular menstrual cycles .
A FSH level was drawn and is pending at the time of dictation .
The gynecology service would like to have follow-up with the patient for routine gynecologic exam , pap smear and estrogen replacement counseling in approximately three months .
Social :
While in house , the patient was seen by social services .
Apparently , the patient lives alone and is without employment .
She has no medical insurance .
It was discussed that the patient should see the social service in outpatient Kingsec Li Hospital .
Exercise treadmill :
Prior to discharge , the patient underwent ETT .
She exercised for three minutes and 40 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol and achieved a peak heart rate of 138 and a peak blood pressure of 145/100 .
This test was stopped because of leg and back pain .
Impression was that the study showed no evidence of ischemia .
History of syphilis :
The patient was treated for syphilis in the 1970's .
RPR during this admission was reactive .
The RPR titer itself was pending at the time of dictation .
Because of the positive RPR titer , FTA was automatically sent off .
However , the usefulness of the FTA is questionable .
The patient should have a follow-up of her RPR titer .
DISPOSITION :
MEDICATIONS :
On discharge included Procardia XL , 90 mg po q a.m .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition .

RALDA ROOM TITCHEKOOPELKS MD
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a long standing history of peripheral vascular disease and tobacco use who has had multiple vascular procedures in the past including a fem-fem bypass , a left fem pop once above the knee with PTFE graph and then again below the knee with a refreshed saphenous vein graft as well as bilateral TMAs and a right fem pop bypass who presents with a nonhealing wound of his left TMA stump as well as a pretibial ulcer that is down to the bone .
The patient was admitted to obtain adequate pain control and to have any MRI / MRA to evaluate any possible bypass procedures that could be performed .
The patient 's Coumadin was held and he was started on heparin drip in order to rapidly reverse him on time for an operation .
He remained in the hospital for the first two days and was unable to receive his MRI until hospital day # 4 at which time , the MRI and MRA showed no possible areas for a bypass graft and it was assessed that an above-knee amputation would be the proper operation to perform .
He was brought down to the operating room on 07/05/03 ; however , wished to wait another day , so his case was postponed .
The following day on 07/06/03 , he was taken to the operating room for a left above the knee amputation .
For a detailed description of the operative procedure , please refer to the dictated operative note .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged to the PACU in a stable condition .

Report Status :

Discharge Date :

PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
LEFT ROTATOR CUFF TEAR .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52-year-old right handed male with a many year history of bilateral shoulder pain , right greater than left .
He has steroid injections in the right and in the left four times .
Arthrogram in the distant past showed a right rotator cuff tear and he now has increased pain in his left shoulder .
MRI by report showed bilateral rotator cuff repairs and he was admitted for repair of the left rotator cuff .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Back pain .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Ankle surgery times two on the right .
Pilonidal cyst removal .
MEDICATIONS :
On admission included Naprosyn .
ALLERGIES :
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES .
HABITS :
The patient smokes two packs per day and has an approximately a 75-pack-year history of smoking .
He has a history of drinking which he discontinued in May .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed a white male with no palpable adenopathy .
HEENT exam was within normal limits .
Lungs revealed occasional wheezing bilaterally at both bases .
Heart was regular with a I / VI systolic ejection murmur without jugular venous distention .
Pulses were 2+ bilaterally .
Abdomen was obese with positive bowel sounds , nontender , nondistended .
Examination of his shoulder revealed the patient to be able to flex his right arm to 170 degrees , internally rotate to 10 degrees and externally rotate to 40 degrees with positive joint tenderness .
All range of motion with his right shoulder was painful .
The left shoulder was identical in range of motion and was also painful .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the assessment of left rotator cuff repair and he was taken to the Operating Room on the day of admission where he underwent left rotator cuff repair under general endotracheal tube anesthesia .
There were no intraoperative complications .
His postoperative course was generally unremarkable except for a prolonged course of advancement with range of motion of his left shoulder .
Occupational therapy became involved initially and he remained on patient controlled analgesia secondary to problems with left shoulder pain .
He was kept in the hospital for an extended period to improve his postoperative range of motion .
However , he was eventually able to achieve forward flexion of 135 degrees and external rotation of 30 degrees by postoperative day number eight .
His wound remained clean and dry and showed no signs of infection and healed well .
However , his course was otherwise complicated by discovery of persistently elevated blood sugars and Endocrinology was consulted to rule out possible newly diagnosed diabetes .
His hemoglobin A1C levels actually came back within normal limits , however , the wide excursions of his sugars were consistent with possible diabetes .
He was placed on a diabetic diet and his sugars did show some improvement .
It was not necessary to start him on oral hypoglycemics or insulin .
He also complained of occasional spells and jitteriness and some orthostatic dizziness and thus Neurology was consulted and EMG 's were performed which were normal .
His neurologist was contacted , Dr. Cap , and the exact of his problems was not demonstrated during this hospitalization , however , they felt that this could possibly be an autonomic type neuropathy maybe secondary to some underlying diabetic process .
Further work-up of his neurologic conditions were planned as an outpatient .
Thus , he was discharged on postoperative day number eight in good condition with a well healed left shoulder wound and doing well with occupational therapy with plans for him to follow-up with Dr. Necessary .

(I). Trop 0.15 , and TWI anterolateral , but likely has some demand w biventricular enlargement w chronic HTN and possible pulm HTN .
Also may have vasospasm w crack use .
Got lovenox 80 in ED , but likely doesn 't need anti-platelet meds as yet .
-- Trop still 0.17 on 3rd draw , likely will take a long time to come down , still no indication for anti-platelet agents
-- ASA 81 , no B blocker because of recent crack use , fasting lipids 2/21/06 actually looked very good with LDL 91 .
ECHO 2/22 shows enlarged LV with EF roughly 25% , biatrial enlargement and moderate mitral regurgitation .
Started bumex ( patient preferred this to lasix because her father had lasix in the past and did poorly ) and lisinopril as an outpatient .
She was assigned to a new cardiologist Dr. Pulefreierm whom she will see one week after discharge .
-- BP control with captopril , converted to lisinopril for discharge . (R) .
NSR , no active issues .
2.) PULM .
CXR slightly improved , afebrile , normal WBC , but had terrible exam on admission .
No antibiotics were given and sputum culture grew oral flora .
She likely has bad lungs with her chronic crack use .

DISPO :
The patient does have underlying psychiatric disease , but did meet criteria for capacity for all medical decisions during her hospitalization .
Given her history of non-compliance and drug abuse , however , the team spoke with 2 family members and her psychiatrist at Lumnerow Health prior to discharge to review the diagnoses and the discharge plan , emphasizing the importance of making her follow-up appointments with Dr. Endo , Dr. Pulefreierm and Br. Still .
Her family members were given phone numbers for all of her physicians to call if there are concerns that she is endangering herself with non-compliance in the future , at which time there may be further discussions regarding capacit / competency , and possible guardianship .
FULL CODE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS :
DO NOT USE CRACK AGAIN .
Your difficulty breathing is partly caused by your smoking and your crack use , your symptoms will get better if you stop using tobacco and crack .
If you do decide to quit you can call 632.264.7348 for help with quitting smoking , and they can direct you to help for quitting crack .
It is also very important that you keep your next appointments with your new doctors , and take all of your medications , including the inhalers , as prescribed .
The Bumex will help keep extra fluid off your heart and help you breath better .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Satisfactory
TO DO / PLAN :
Will need follow-up chest CT to check for resolution of R pleural effusion , to be checked by new PCP .

His coagulation profile was within normal limits .
Chest x-ray revealed a small right lower lobe infiltrate , on the 14th , with a tiny effusion on the 20th , the night of admission .
The pneumonia was now noted to be much larger , with a new right middle lobe infiltrate , as well as with a diffuse reticular interstitial pattern noted at the fringes of the pneumonic infiltrate .
Sputums were sent off for gram stain and culture , as well as for AFB smear cultures .
His electrocardiogram was within normal limits .
His urine sediment was basically within normal limits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Cliffestreukote was admitted on the night of the 20th , for obvious right lung pneumonia .
The differential diagnosis included several organisms as outlined below .
(1) Pneumonia .
He was admitted for a pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics for five days .
The pneumonia was found to be multilobar , and accompanied by significant hypoxia .
He was started on broad spectrum coverage , including ceftriaxone , Clindamycin , and Ciprofloxacin .
The ration off for the utilization of the Ciprofloxacin , was that because of his allergy to Erythromycin , an alternative regimen was needed to cover for Legionella , which was probably the leading diagnosis at the time of admission , because of his hyponatremia accompanied by liver function abnormalities .
However , he was isolated , and three AFB smears were obtained , in order to rule out tuberculosis .
In addition , sputum induction was performed for Pneumocystis , which was negative .
His urinary Legionella antigen subsequently came back negative .
However , this test is only 85-95% sensitive for Legionella pneumophila , type I , which is the subtype that causes some 80% of legionnaires disease .
However , the Legionella antigen is neither sensitive , nor specific , for other Legionella species that may be involved in Legionella pneumonia .
Therefore , the Ciprofloxacin was continued .
In addition , his sputum cultures were all negative , as of the day of admission .
After admission , with the initiation of antibiotic therapy , Mr. Cliffestreukote remained quite hypoxic .
However , within one to two days after admission , he defervesced with a significant decrease in his cough during the week , post admission .
Because of persistent hypoxemia on room air , as well as nasal cannula , some concern was raised about the possibility of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , versus some other lesion that may predispose him for persistent hypoxemia , ( i.e. malignancy ) .
Therefore , an evaluation by the Pulmonary Team of the Tonwe Hospital , as well as a sputum cytology and chest CT scan , were all obtained .
The chest CT scan revealed evidence for emphysematous changes of his lungs , as well as the previously noted right pneumonia , with several pseudo abscesses noted in infected bullae .
His sputum cytology is pending at the time of discharge .
The Pulmonary Team felt that the patient exhibited significant physical findings , laboratory values , and radiologic features , all consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Therefore , his persistent hypoxemia may be secondary to that underlying disease .
Despite being afebrile , with significant decrease in his cough , Mr. Cliffestreukote will be maintained , after discharge , on eleven more days of antibiotic therapy , to complete a full course .
It should be noted , that Clindamycin was discontinued , approximately three days after admission , because of the development of diarrhea .
Additionally , when switched to oral medication , Mr. Cliffestreukote was switched to Augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , as well as continuing on his Ciprofloxacin 150 mg. p.o. b.i.d.
(2) Hypertension .
While in the hospital , Mr. Cliffestreukote was maintained on hydrochlorothiazide , and Verapamil SR , and required no additional medication .
(3) Hyponatremia .
While in the hospital , persistent type of natremia was noted on the patient 's Profile 7 labs .
It was felt that this was due largely to his pulmonary disease , and would resolve with the resolution of his intrapneumonic process .
While in the hospital , there were no complications .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. for eleven more days , Ciprofloxacin 750 mg. p.o. b.i.d. for eleven days , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. p.o. q. day , Verapamil SR 240 mg. p.o. q. day , and Atrovent meter dose inhaler two puffs four times a day .
DISPOSITION :
His condition on discharge was stable .
He was discharged to home .
He has a followup appointment with Dr. Naaan Jesc , in the Tonwe Hospital Pulmonary Clinic on 2-18-95 , at 9:45 A.M. , as well as with his primary care physician , Dr. Rybam Selcjescpint .
His estimated disability is mild .
We are still awaiting the results of his HIV testing .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Orthostatic hypotension .
OTHER PROBLEMS :
Hyponatremia .
Hypokalemia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 66 year old white female without a significant past medical history who presented in the Middso Memorial Hospital Emergency Room following a nine day history of dizziness on standing without loss of consciousness .
During the week prior to admission , the patient complained of severe constipation , dry mouth , possible urinary retention along with some nausea and vomiting .
She felt that she was profoundly cold at the time .
In the emergency room , the patient was hypotensive with an initial blood pressure of 92/70 and a pulse of 96 lying flat that became 70/50 with a pulse of 104 when standing .
The patient was aggressively hydrated with a total of 9 liters of normal saline over a 7 hour period with marginal increase in blood pressure .
Over the same period of time , the patient became increasingly hypoxic and developed worsening hypertension .
Stat chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema .
The patient was subsequently transferred to the MICU on Dopamine for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Only noticeable for remote appendectomy and being gravida V , para V .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient has an 80-pack-year history of tobacco and is currently smoking 1-2 packs per day .
She also has a questionable alcohol history of up to one quart daily .
She is married and lives with her husband .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Notable for coronary artery disease in both parents without a history of cancer or autoimmune disease , diabetes , thyroid disease .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an agitated elderly white female .
Temperature 97.8 , blood pressure 112/58 on Dopamine , pulse 134 , respirations 28 , oxygen saturation 93% on 100% nonrebreather .
HEENT :
Showed pupils equal , round and reactive to light .
Extraocular muscles intact .
Oropharynx benign .
Eyebrows were notable for lateral thinning .
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy .
Carotids were 2+ .
No palpable thyroid .
Lungs showed decreased breath sounds bilaterally .
Cardiac exam revealed S1 , S2 with an intermittent S4 without murmur or rubs .
Abdominal exam was benign .
Extremities showed mild clubbing , no cyanosis and no edema .
Neurologic exam :
The patient was alert , agitated and oriented to name , date and place moving all extremities .
Light touch was intact .
ADMISSION LABS :
Sodium 127 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 76 , bicarb 35 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 105 , serum osmolality 254 , hematocrit 43.5 , white count 10.0 with 68% polys , 20% lymphs and 10 monos .
Platelets 310 .
PT and PTT were normal .
LFT 's were within normal limits .
Admission cortisol , aldosterone , B12 and folate and TSH were drawn .
Chest x-ray on transfer to the MICU showed pulmonary vascular redistribution without infiltrate , effusions or nodules as compared with an admission chest x-ray which was interpreted as clear .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
In the MICU , the patient initially required Dopamine for five days , at which point , she tolerated a wean without recurrent light headedness , dizziness or syncope .
Echocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities .
The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed which showed a cardiac output of 8 with systemic vascular resistance of 700 .
Because the Swan-Ganz readings were felt to be explained by sepsis , the patient was treated empirically with Cefotaxime , Gentamicin and Flagyl .
All cultures were subsequently negative with the exception of an E coli UTI .
The infectious workup included a lumbar puncture which was negative for pleocytosis but showed an elevated glucose of 106 and an elevated protein of 76 .
The patient had an extensive workup for hypopituitarism .
Because Addisonian crisis could not be initially ruled out , the patient was placed on distressed dose Cortisone .
However , a random cortisol level drawn initially in the emergency room subsequently returned as normal .
The patient also responded appropriately to Cortrosyn stimulation test .
Also , TSH was normal on admission .
Thyroid function panel drawn while the patient was on Dopamine was subsequently abnormal .
However , repeat panel was drawn when the patient was stable and had been transferred to the floor and was pending at the time of discharge .
The patient was also evaluated by the neurology service for possible dysautonomia as the cause of her orthostatic hypotension with an inappropriate heart rate response to hypotension .
EMG showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy .
Additional studies also included a head CT that showed a small Lacunar infarct in the right pons and a partial empty sella which was confirmed by head MRI .
Other studies sent during the workup included a negative serum and urine protein electrophoresis , negative serum and urine immunoglobulin electrophoresis .
LH and SSH levels were consistent with a post-menopausal state .
Galactin levels were within normal limits .
ANA was negative .
Ace level was negative .
Heavy metal screen was negative except for a slightly elevated cobalt level so a possibility of a perineoplastic syndrome was considered .
An anti-YO RI and WHO antibodies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge .
On hospital day eight , the patient had uneventfully weaned off Dopamine and was transferred to the floor .
At that time , the stress dose Hydrocortisone was weaned and the patient was switched to Prednisone without any evidence of recurrent hypotension .
Her initial hyponatremia and hypokalemia resolved with stable sodium and potassium levels prior to discharge .
In the studying of aggressive fluid resuscitation , it was felt that the patient had been sent into pulmonary edema .
The patient auto-diuresed spontaneously .
Subsequent to the diuresis , reticulonodular diffuse pattern became apparent on chest x-ray .
Because of the patient 's significant smoking history , chest PT was performed to evaluate the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis .
However , the chest CT showed relative sparing of the lower lobes with primary involvement in both upper lobes .
The patient following diuresis had no oxygen requirement whatsoever and had no respiratory complaints .
Prior to discharge , she was evaluated by the pulmonary service who felt that the differential diagnosis for her chest CT included eosinophilic granuloma , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , less likely sarcoidosis .
Because the patient had no respiratory symptoms , it was felt that her abnormal chest CT would be best evaluated as an out-patient .
A new baseline chest x-ray was obtained prior to discharge .
She will also require baseline pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Prednisone taper 40 mg p.o. q day times two days , 30 mg p.o. q day times two days , 20 mg p.o. q day times three days , 10 mg p.o. q day times three days , 5 mg p.o. q day times three days .
Multi-vitamin one p.o. q day .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DISPOSITION :
The patient will be discharged to home .
She will follow-up with Jacrendonate Sella , M.D. on 8/6/95 .
She will need a pulmonary referral and pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .
At the time of discharge , studies that were pending included a repeat thyroid function panel , aldosterone levels and anti-WHO and anti-YO and RI antibodies .

Follow-up chest x-ray done showed some scarring and this was followed with a chest x-ray in 2004 showing no changes .
This was then followed with a CT scan in 2004 showing a solid pulmonary nodule that was slightly larger .
This resulted in PET scan done in 03/14/04 , which showed minimal pulmonary activity .
There was no FTG uptake in the lungs or in the pancreas , but the CT scan showed a 1.9-cm low-attenuation lesion in the head of the pancreas .
This was followed by an MRCP on 04/20/05 and this showed a 1.3 to 2.2-cm cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas .

The patient was admitted to Vascular Surgery Service as a same day admission , and taken to the operating room for an uncomplicated endovascular repair of his abdominal aortic aneurysm , and Anurx modular bifurcated graft was placed , and both common femoral arteries were repaired in the usual fashion .
He had pulsatile pulse volume recordings , in both lower extremities , and both renal arteries were noted to be patent , as were both internal iliac arteries .
His angiogram in the operating room , revealed no evidence of an endo leak .
Postoperatively , his course was relatively uncomplicated .
He did have an episode of a prolonged sinus pause in the recovery room , which resulted in transient loss of consciousness .
He responded to a Neo-Synephrine bolus , and had no further complications from this standpoint .
Dr. Rosean Fletcher , of the Cardiology Department was consulted , and it was his opinion that the sinus pause was related to increased vagal tone postoperatively , perhaps secondary to the epidural , as well as the patient 's Atenolol use .
His Atenolol was held , and he had no further pauses during his stay .
His postoperative CT scan showed no evidence of endo leak , or graft kinking .
He maintained good peripheral pulses and warm feet postoperatively .
However , he did develop significant ecchymosis in both groins , extending down into his scrotum .

IMPRESSION AND PLAN :
This is a 63-year-old lady with stage IV colon cancer , status post three chemo regimens , then she was on a phase one trial .
She presented with increasing LFTs and renal failure .
1. Hypertension , infectious disease .
The patient was hypertensive to 60s through much of her stay .
She had E. coli in her urine and she was placed on Levaquin .
Differential diagnosis included urosepsis and intravascular sleep depletion .
Because of her rising LFTs and renal failure , she was thought to be in hepatorenal , see below .
We continued to administer serum-poor albumin throughout the day even until her death .
2. Renal failure .
The patient was in acute renal failure and had hypertension .
The differential diagnosis included hypertension , hypovolemia , and nephrotoxicity due to the drug , and tumor lysis leading to hepatorenal or hepatorenal in itself .
The patient had a renal ultrasound .
This showed mild left hydronephrosis , no real etiology for this .
Her creatinine is slowly climbed to greater than 4.6 upon her death .
She was in fluid restriction to 1.5 litres a day .
Renal failure was thought likely to be due to hypovolemia from hyperperfusion as well as hepatorenal syndrome .
We continued allopurinol .
3. Increasing LFTs and INR .
The patient had increasing LFTs and her T. bili climbed to greater than 9 upon death .
This is likely due to hepatorenal syndrome .
Also , the patient could have had the tumor metabolizing .
There was no evidence of obstruction .
4. The patient 's increased LDH , uric acid , and BUN and creatinine are all consistent with tumor lysis .
This is likely thought to be due to an increased tumor burden and not necessarily from the medication .
It became clear throughout the patient 's hospital course that she was becoming very sick and the patient accepted this .
With her wishes that her she was DNR / DNI , we eventually made her CMO , comfort measures only .
She was awake and entertaining friends and family through most of her hospital stay .
She often may talk openly about her death that was impending .
On the two days prior to her death , she was more unresponsive and on the day of her death , she was unconscious through most of the day .
The patient was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. on 04/16/05 .
One of her sons and her nephew were present in the room .
The family decline autopsy and the chaplain visited .

With exertion , she was noted to desaturate to the mid 70s .
There was no significant JVP elevation .
Breath sounds were diminished at the right base along with dullness to percussion at the right base .
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with a normal P2 .
There was no RV heave .
No murmur was appreciated .
Abdomen was mildly distended , but soft and nontender .

After the thoracentesis , Ms. Walking 's ambulatory room air saturation was 94% and she was feeling better .
Ms. Walking also underwent echocardiogram .
Her LV ejection fraction was 77% .
The estimated RV systolic pressure was 47 .
Because of a concern of a solid mass on the lesser curvature of her stomach noted by abdominal CAT scan , Ms. Walking had a GI consultation .
The gastroenterologist performed an EGD and EUS .
The EGD showed a normal esophagus , a submucosal mass in the cardia and fundus of the stomach with central umbilication , nodularity in the prepyloric antrum , and a normal duodenum .
The EUS showed a normal common bile duct , normal pancreas and a 4-cm gastric wall solid mass , which was hypoechoic , heterogenetic and lobulated in appearance .
She had biopsies taken , which are pending at this time .

CBC , white count 6.7 , hematocrit 37.4 , platelets 280 .
Chest x-ray was low lung volumes , no consolidation .
EKG showed sinus brady at 16 , normal axis , normal intervals , no STT wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Team Four for cardiac monitoring and ruling out for MI .
Hospital course by system :
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient ruled out for MI by cardiac markers .
The patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of COPD , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension .
The next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) .
This echo showed LV ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality .
However , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic .
It was suboptimally imaged , so there was no RVSP given .
The patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her EGD on 11/17/04 .
This responded to fluid bolus .
The patient was then transferred to Medicine Team D given her tenuous hemodynamic status .
The patient , several days later 11/23 , underwent another dobutamine stress test .
This stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 's or 70 's was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an EF from this test was 76% .
Clearly , the patient 's hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine .
2. Infectious Disease :
On hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion .
The next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential UTI .
She continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , 11/17/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates .
She was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .
Her urine legionella antigen was negative .
On 11/22/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum .
She was started on vancomycin for this .
These bacteria turned out to be MRSA and she was continued on her vancomycin .
She had PICC line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration .
3. GI :
The patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis .
GI was consulted for an EGD , however , while she was in the Endoscopy Suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses .
Finally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her EGD .
The EGD did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis .
Her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her Nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus .
4. Shortness of breath :
As mentioned above , the patient did develop MRSA pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge .
At most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula .
This was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest CT .
5. Derm :
Several days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast .
She was started on some Miconazole Cream .
The rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side .
The rash appeared to be resolving by the time of discharge .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tums , 500-1250 mg PO tid .
Albuterol inhaler .
Lipitor , 20 daily .
Prozac , 60 daily .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Gait disorder .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31-year-old right-handed female with right-sided greater than left-sided weakness and difficulty walking for several days .
She was in her usual state of health until 3/20/97 when she experienced the fairly sudden onset of predominantly right-sided arm and leg weakness and ataxia .
She was standing and walking with her friend , who "" had to catch her from falling down "" as she toppled towards the right .
She evidently recovered from the episode after a number of minutes .
The following day , she remained in bed through essentially all of the day due to malaise with no specific deficits being noted .
In the subsequent two days , she had several small spells of "" imbalance "" , particularly towards the right , and other symptoms included diffuse and mainly frontal headaches and mild neck soreness .
There was no diplopia , visual loss , speech abnormality or sensory change in her history .
She was initially evaluated at an outside hospital emergency room , and then transferred to Well General Hospital .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for depression , and she has been followed regularly by Dr. Freiermchird of Nash Health for several months with pharmacologic treatment , which is apparently working well .
Her Doxepin has recently been increased .
She is status post appendectomy and otherwise has no remarkable past medical history .
ALLERGIES :
Quinine gives her a rash .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
The only medications she is on are Paxil 30 mg p.o. q.day , Doxepin 25 mg p.o. q.day , and Klonopin 2 mg p.o. q.h.s.
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is currently unemployed , but until recently , she was employed at a bank .
She was born and raised in Atonlaremont Rockpo .
There is a history of childhood abuse .
She does not drink .
She is a former tobacco user and takes no illicit drugs .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was pleasant , in no acute distress ; blood pressure 130/60 ; heart rate 66 ; respirations 18 ; temperature 98 .
Her thyroid was within normal limits .
There were no carotid or cervical bruits .
She had a normal S1 and S2 and regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Her abdomen was benign .
Her extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis , edema , or rash ; there were some older hematomas in the bilaterally shins .
Mental status - her speech was fluent without errors .
Her affect was slightly inappropriate at times ; for example , singing or humming along while performing some of the motor tasks and giving the impression of indifference to the deficits that were demonstrated on the examination .
Her memory was fully intact for short-term recollection of three out of three objects at five minutes with excellent naming , repetition , proverb interpretation , and ability to follow commands .
Visual fields were full to confrontation .
Her left pupil was 7 mm reacting to 5 mm .
Her right pupil was 5.5 mm reacting to 4 mm .
Her extraocular movements were intact for horizontal and vertical pursuits .
There was no nystagmus and no ptosis .
Her saccades were normal .
Facial strength and sensation were full and symmetric .
Her tongue , uvula and palate were midline .
Shoulder shrug was 5/5 power .
Motor examination revealed 5/5 power in all groups in the proximal and distal upper and lower extremities .
There was no drift .
There was normal bulk and tone .
She had slightly slow fine finger motility approximately equal bilaterally , although this was extremely difficult to reproduce .
Sensory - intact light touch , temperature , and vibration overall .
Reflexes were 2+ throughout in the upper and lower extremities , and toes were downgoing .
There was no jaw jerk and no Hoffman 's sign .
Coordination - toe tap was slow bilaterally , although difficult to reproduce , and at best , was essentially within normal limits .
On standing , she tended to fall to the front , back or sides without trying to stop her fall initially , and extensive gait testing was deferred due to concerns for safety .
Her heel-to-shin and finger-to-nose testing was fully intact bilaterally without ataxia or tremor .
LABORATORY DATA :
Were unremarkable with normal electrolytes and complete blood count parameters .
Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 .
Her coagulation parameters were normal .
Head CT scan without contrast showed normal brain parenchyma and no intracranial process .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted for her gait disorder with other notable findings on examination including anisocoria , which , by the patient 's report , had been noted several months earlier .
A magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram study was obtained , which showed no clear evidence of arterial dissections or infarction or other pathologic processes .
She had been placed on heparin initially , but this was discontinued after the magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained .
Posterior transcranial Doppler studies showed normal studies of both vertebral arteries , and carotid non-invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations .
On the second hospital day , her gait continued to be markedly unstable , although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling , and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria .
She was seen by the Psychiatry Service .
She was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment .
The psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology .
The patient was evaluated in one of the neurology conferences for several hours , and during this time , showed significant improvement while receiving gait training as well as evaluation ; in particular , she became more stable with counter-balancing methods .
This trend of improvement continued , and she was discharged in stable condition .
She will follow up with her psychiatrist , Dr. Freiermchird ( Sone Memorial Hospital ) on a regular basis , and she can follow up with the Neurology Service on a p.r.n. basis if needed .
She will continue on her previous outpatient medical regimen .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
1) EXTENSIVE POSTERIOR CIRCULATION INFARCTION .
2) ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 82 year-old right handed gentleman who has a past medical history of hypertension and tobacco use presented to the emergency room with acute change in mental status .
He was well until the evening prior to presentation to the emergency room when he complained of headache across the forehead .
On the day of presentation , he was then found by his daughter lying on his bed groaning , being relatively unresponsive and unable to speak .
The family reported one episode of vomiting at home .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile , heart rate 73 , blood pressure 158/53 , respiratory rate 16-20 , oxygen saturation 97% on three liters .
General :
The patient was somnolent , breathing comfortably , occasionally coughing .
Neck was supple with full range of motion .
No bruits were heard .
Chest was clear to auscultation but with poor air entry .
Heart sounds were regular with one out of six holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Abdomen was soft , non-tender , bowel sounds present .
Extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Neurological examination revealed a patient who was intermittently alert , opening eyes to voice , following simple commands , but without any speech .
Pupils were 4 mm reactive to 2 mm bilaterally .
There was no pupillary defect .
Dolls eye was negative .
There was a possible right gaze preference and the patient did not move his eyes .
Corneals were present bilaterally .
Gag was present weakly .
Face was symmetrical .
Tongue was midline .
The patient was moving the right side spontaneously , but could not hold arm or leg up for any length of time .
There was only minimal movement on the left side .
On sensory testing , the patient withdrew all extremities to pain .
Reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical all over .
The left toe was upgoing , the right toe was downgoing .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory data revealed a sodium of 139 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN 11 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 151 .
AST was 20 , ALT 12 , alkaline phosphatase 80 , bilirubin 0.5. CK was 113 .
Thyroid function tests were normal .
Troponin I was 0.05 .
Total protein was 8 , albumin 4.3 , globulin 3.7 , calcium 9.9 , phosphate 2.7 , magnesium 2.0. White blood cell count was 7 , hemoglobin 14.1 , hematocrit 43.6 , platelet count 241 .
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 41 .
PT was 12.3 , PTT 27.1. An EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 53 with a normal axis , first degree atrioventricular block , biphasic T-waves in V1 to V3 without any acute changes .
A chest x-ray shows left lower lobe consolidation .
The head CT scan revealed a large right occipital infarct without midline shift , but positive mass effect on the temporal horn , on the right ventricle and some effacement of the sulci in the right parietal area .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin .
Around 4:00 AM the next day , an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted .
Lung examination at that point showed good air entry , no wheezing , coarse breath sounds throughout .
Neurologically , the patient was not following commands .
Eyes were closed .
He was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously , though less than before .
Withdrawal to pain was still present .
Both plantars were upgoing .
A blood gas at this point showed a pH of 7.49 , pO2 61 , pCO2 of 33 on 100% non-rebreather mask .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia .
The patient 's temperature was 102 degrees .
A repeat CAT scan of the head was performed .
This showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere .
There was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage .
At this point , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit .
An MRI and MRA of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation .
The MRI showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally , the right occipital lobe , the right thalamus and bilateral pons .
The MRA of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries .
The left vertebral artery was not visualized .
There was a dominant right vertebral artery .
There was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left .
There was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries .
Clinically , the patient continued to deteriorate .
Neurosurgery was consulted , however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation .
The patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management .
Heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage .
The aspiration pneumonia was treated with Cefotaxime and Metronidazole .
The patient 's family was involved and they decided to opt for DNR / DNI in view of the poor prognosis .
The patient passed away at 6:45 AM on June 12 , 1998 .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
chest pain , ruled out for myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
asthma .
HISTORY :
52-year-old female , with a history of of nonsteroid dependent asthma , presenting with chest discomfort .
The patient stated that the previous week while in a pulmonary rehabilitation program , she underwent an exercise tolerance test .
During the procedure , she complained of a squeezing sensation in the chest , apparently associated with electrocardiographic abnormalities .
The day of admission , she noted the onset of the same chest pressure , radiating to the right shoulder , which she described as an "" awful feeling in her chest . ""
This lasted several hours and was relieved in the Emergency Department .
Mild nausea but not other cardiac related symptoms .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
history of cigarette use , post menopausal , hypercholesterolemia .
In 1991 , she had an equivocal exercise tolerance test with a normal thallium study .
The patient also described a long history of "" cold weather "" exertion related chest discomfort that involved her "" sternum , back and insides , "" associated with asthma but not relieved by metered dose inhalers .
This symptoms she reports has been stable for years and was different than her presenting complaints .
On PHYSICAL EXAMINATION , 110/80 bilaterally , 68 , 18 .
Black female in no apparent distress .
Chest clear to auscultation .
Cardiovascular :
regular , without murmur , gallop or rub .
No increased jugular venous pressure .
Abdomen soft , nontender , no hepatosplenomegaly , no abdominal aortic aneurysm .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema or G .
Rectal :
guaiac negative .
Electrocardiogram :
poor R-wave progression , no change versus 12/93 .
Chest x-ray study :
low volumes , no active disease .
ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES :
complete blood count , electrolytes , creatinine normal .
This 52-year-old patient with a history of asthma , atypical chest pain , and recently positive exercise tolerance test was admitted to the medical service with a similar chest pain , which was not associated with electrocardiogram changes .
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction by creatine kinase enzymes .
Given the similarity of her current presentation to her recent positive stress test , and wish to avoid beta blockade , due to her asthma , an inpatient thallium study was ordered .
While in the hospital she remained pain free .
She exhibited no bronchospasm while taking enteric coated aspirin .
When an exercise thallium study was unable to be obtained 48 hours after admission , the patient was discharged to follow up for an out patient study and with her internist , Dr. Kanner .
At discharge , she looked and felt well .

At the time of transfer to the ________ Onc Service , blood pressure was within the normal range .
3. Pulmonary :
The patient was extubated on 11/22/03 .
Once the patient was extubated , after the third surgery , the patient could not be weaned off 2 liters of nasal cannula and was to ______ to 20 breaths per minute despite nebulizer treatment .
The patient was restarted on Advair and by 12/15/03 , was weaned to room air likely an effective Advair and control of anxiety and psychiatric issues .
4. GI :
On postoperative day 4 , after the initial surgery , the patient had increased shortness of breath and tachycardia with abdominal pain .

On postop day 9 , the patient had a similar increased abdominal pain episode and was taken back to the operating room for another emergent exploratory laparotomy revealing another peroration at the site of previous repair .
Intraoperatively , the patient suffered hypotension with induction and respiratory insufficiency .
The patient was transferred to the ICU intubated with stable .
The patient was kept NPO with an NG tube until postop day 14 and_____ started on clear sips with TPN for nutritional supplementation .
The patient intermittently tolerated diet advancement , but then would vomit and would have the NG tube replaced .
The patient , at the time of transfer , was tolerating clears with low stoma output , likely to tolerate slow advancement .
The patient still had a PICC line at the time , although TPN was being held and calorie counts were done to evaluate the benefit of p.o. nutrition .
5. GU :

IDENTIFICATION DATA :
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a 22 week intrauterine pregnancy who was transferred from Bri Health with diffuse metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was in her usual state of excellent health until July of 1991 when she first noted a left clavicular mass .
Subsequently , the mass continued to increase in size .
On 12/23 , she was seen by Dr. Stonge at Bri Health where a 3 x 7 cm left mid clavicular mass was noted .
A fine needle aspirate of this mass reportedly revealed giant cell tumor .
The patient was initially told that this was a benign tumor and that it could simply be watched and definitively treated after the delivery of her baby .
Subsequently , the mass progressively increased in size and the patient had developed significant discomfort in this region .
On 1/5 , the patient underwent a local tumor debulking at Bri Health under local anesthesia .
The pathology , unfortunately , revealed an aggressive adenocarcinoma ( micropapillary type ; mucin producing ) .
This prompted further staging work-up .
The patient subsequently had a limited chest CT at Bri Health which showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases , metastases to the sternum , rib , multiple spinal levels ; internal mammary lymphadenopathy .
The poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal CT scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .
There was no obvious GIor pancreatic tumor identified .
The patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .
A specimen was obtained by fine needle aspiration and the pathology of this was consistent with adenocarcinoma .
The patient was transferred to Nimaconwood Valley Hospital for management of her cancer and termination of the pregnancy .
Over the past four weeks , the patient reported progressive shortness of breath and mid thoracic back pain .

Calcium 11.8 .
Albumin 2.3 .
Hematocrit was 30.6 .
White blood cell count was 11.14 .
PT was 13.2 .
PTT was 29.8 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient had an elective termination of her pregnancy on 1/13/91 .
The work-up for the extent of the patient 's disease included MRI scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a T3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .
An epidural mass was present at T10 which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan with IV contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic IVC and distention of the azygous system suggestive of IVC obstruction by liver metastases ; ascites ; multiple bony metastases ; and an isolated splenic metastases .
A bone scan revealed increased uptake in the left chest wall , left anterior ribs four to six , and increased uptake in the left and right lateral skull in the area of the parotids .
Ahead CT scan revealed a metastatic lesion in the right vertex of the calvarium but no intracranial abnormalities .
Work-up for the source of the primary tumor which is still unknown included a mammogram which identified no suspicious microcalcifications and no dominant masses .
The abdominal and pelvic CT scans showed no suspicious GI masses , no pancreatic mass ; a 2 cm ovarian cyst .
The review of the pathology from Bri Health confirmed a high grade adenocarcinoma .

The patient was then switched to po etidronate .
IVC obstruction :
The patient has extensive hepatic metastases and by CT scan there is obstruction of the intrahepatic IVC .
This has resulted in marked bilateral lower extremity and presacral edema with ascites .
The patient 's low serum albumin is also contributing to her extensive edema .
Hypoxia and shortness of breath :
Although the patient 's room air saturation was 96% during this admission , she subjectively complained of increased shortness of breath .
It was felt that the patient 's extensive pulmonary metastases and bilateral pleural effusions resulted in increased work of respiration and a sensation of shortness of breath .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 70-year-old female with cryptogenic cirrhosis .
She has a history of esophageal varices and a history of an Upper GI bleed .
She has had one pervious episode of variceal bleeding with an unclear date .
However she is followed by a Dr. Joasscchird at Vaila Medical Center .
She was in her usual state of health until one day prior to admission when she felt increasing fatigue , nausea and vomiting productive of bright red blood and coffee ground emesis .
She also had some black , tarry stool in her colostomy bag .
At Vaila Medical Center , she had a hematocrit of 25 and was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells .
She had an upper endoscopy at Va Sit Namar Healthcare showing an esophagus filled with clots and small amount of bleeding varices , clot in the stomach with antral gastritis , and a normal duodenum .

She was transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Intensive Care Unit where on January 25 in the morning her hematocrit was found to be 27.4 .
She was transfused another 2 units of packed red blood cells over the course of the day and her hematocrit improved to 29.4 and then 31.2 .
The GI service was consulted and an upper endoscopy study showed grade III varices with no active bleeding and a clean base gastric ulcer possibly secondary to the Blakemore tube .
Her varices had stigmata of recent bleeding , were banded successfully .
after the procedure and 2 more units of packed red blood cells , the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit was stable at 31.2 .
At that time she was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to Coden 2 for the Lemgarson Hospital service .

LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for sodium 141 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 109 , bicarb 19.8 , BUN 38 , creatinine 1.2 and glucose 388 .
She had a pneumonia of 31 , calcium was 7.5 , phosphorous 3.0 , magnesium 1.3 .
Her bilirubin was 1.4 total , 0.2 direct .
alkaline phosphatase 101 .
SGPT 22 , SGOT 41 , amylase 31 , lipase less than 1 .
LDH was 38.9 , CK was 66 , her hematocrit was 27.4 , white count was 8.0 and her platelets were 55 .
PT was 14.5 , PTT 25.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
As described above the patient was transfused an additional 2 units in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient also received an upper endoscopy study and her varices were banded .
On transfer to the Lemgarson Hospital service , her hematocrit was 31.2 , white count 11.1 and a platelet count 80 .
Her PT was 13.1 , PTT 26.7 .
The rest of her labs were unremarkable .
She was watched very closely while on the floor .
She was on GI bleed precautions at all times , was too large for IV .
She had a clot at the blood bank and she had BID hematocrits checked .
She was kept NPO until January 26 when she began to feel hungry .
At that time clear liquids were started .
All of her stools were guaiaced .
She also began Nadolol 40 mg QD to reduce her portal hypertension .
The GI consult team continued to follow her .
We also tried to contact her physician at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and was unsuccessful .
Therefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .
She was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .
Her ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .
She also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .
Over the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .
She did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding .
Her hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 .
We also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis .
The peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244 , total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5 , globulin 0.3 , amylase 16 , LDH of 51 .
The serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .
The cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16% polys .
She therefore _________ criteria for a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis .
Her platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to Cimetidine .
Therefore we switched her Cimetidine to Prilosec .
By the 2th the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .
She wanted to be closer to North Dakota .
After discussion with her private physician , Dr. Joasscchird , tel. 090-249-6079 , at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and Dr. Acrookesjo at Do Of Hospital , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with AH and physical therapy .
She was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .
She is to follow up with Dr. Acrookesjo in one week and Dr. Work the gastrointestinal fellow here at PUOMC in 2 weeks .
She may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding .
The patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker , therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Zoloft 50 mg PO QD , Lactulose 15 g PO BID , Synthroid 0.15 mg PO QD , Prilosec 20 mg PO BID .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :

Over the few months prior to admission the patient has had increasing dyspnea on exertion and increasing weight gain to the tune of approximately 30 lbs despite increasing diuresis by her primary care physician .
An echocardiogram at the Ph University Of Medical Center in 1997 revealed a normal ejection fraction and no wall motion abnormality .
By her primary care physicians report an echocardiogram at an outside hospital in June 1999 revealed mild left atrial enlargement and mild right ventricular dilatation .
The primary care physician also reports an increasing new mitral regurgitation murmur over the past several weeks .
The patient has a Persantin Thallium stress test at an outside hospital on 11/22/99 which reportedly was negative for ischemia .
She has had no chest pain .
She does not smoke and has no history of coronary artery disease .
Three days prior to admission , secondary to increasing difficulty with ambulation and dyspnea on exertion the patient was admitted to a nursing home .
Outside the hospital the patient is non-compliant with her diet running her sugars in the 200s despite NPH insulin .
On arrival to the nursing home she was fed an in-house diet which was markedly less coloric and sugar filled than her home diet .
Early on the morning of admission the patient was found down , diaphoretic and responsive only to sternal rub .
She had a witnessed seizure-like episode .
Her blood sugar was 48 .
Emergency Medical Service was called .
The patient was intubated , given thiamine and D50 as well as intravenous Lasix and she was transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Emergency Room .
In the Ph University Of Medical Center Emergency Room she was afebrile with a blood pressure 150/80 , heart rate in the 60s , oxygen saturation of 100% .
She was arousable to sternal rub only .
She had minimal crackles bilaterally and had an unremarkable electrocardiogram .
Her chest x-ray showed only mild failure .
She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus complicated by neuropathy , nephropathy and retinopathy status post laser treatment .
Severe degenerative joint disease of the spine and knees .
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation given a history of gastrointestinal bleed .

Right heel ulcer with eschar .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Plasma sodium 134 , plasma carbon dioxide 34.8 , blood urea nitrogen 67 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 165 , liver function tests were normal .
Amylase 473 , lipase 6.8 , white blood cell count 7.4 , hematocrit 32.4 , platelets 222 .
Urine analysis showed no urinary tract infection .
Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrate and minimal linear atelectasis in the right mid lung zone .
KUB showed no bowel obstruction .
Electrocardiogram had normal sinus rhythm with no changes compared with prior electrocardiogram .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By system .
1. ENDOCRINE :
The patient 's seizure was thought to be secondary to hypoglycemia in the setting of decreased oral intake on her standard anti-glycemic medications .
She will be transferred back to her long term care facility on a CZI sliding scale for close management of her sugars pending further assessment of her baseline anti-glycemic medication needs .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has a history of transient ischemic attacks in the past .
Her seizure was thought secondary to hypoglycemia and she had no further seizure activity in the hospital .
She did have some slightly paranoid behavior which her son says is typical .
She was continued on her Trazodone , Neurontin and Zyprexa .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient had an echocardiogram which revealed a normal ejection fraction , no wall motion abnormalities but mitral stenosis with peak gradient of 19 and mean gradient of 9 , dilated right ventricle , dilated right atrium , and right ventricle systolic pressure in the 60s .
She was aggressively diuresed and her shortness of breath somewhat improved as did her pedal edema .
After discussion with her primary care physician it was decided that she would have further cardiology assessment as an outpatient .
4. PULMONARY :
The patient was extubated quickly after her admission and maintained good oxygen saturation .
She was aggressively diuresed for her minimal congestive heart failure .
5. GASTROINTESTINAL :
The patient had guaiac positive stools and had an elevated amylase without an elevated lipase .
These findings suggest some bowel pathology .
The patient is known to have had an upper gastrointestinal bleed in 1997 in the context of Coumadin .
An outpatient gastrointestinal workup may be indicated .
6. RENAL :
The patient maintained her baseline creatinine which reflects chronic renal insufficiency secondary to her diabetes .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient was treated on Unasyn for concern of cellulitis .
The patient 's lower extremities were bilaterally erythematous consistent with chronic venous stasis .
However she did have a low grade temperature to 100F and it was thought that given her diabetes and ulcer on her heel she should be covered for possible cellulitis .
She will be discharged on a one week course of Augmentin .
The patient was discharged to her chronic care facility on 11/27/99 in stable condition .

Reflexes were 3+ throughout except 2+ at the ankles .
Toes were upgoing bilaterally .
Grip was 4+ on the left and less than 3 on the right .
Biceps were 3 on the right and 5 minus on the left .
Triceps were 2+ on the right and 5 minus on the left .
Deltoids were 3+ on the right and 4 minus on the left .
Hip flexors were less than 3 bilaterally .
Knee flexors were 4+ bilaterally .
Knee extensors were 3+ bilaterally .
Ankle dorsiflexors were 3 minus bilaterally and plantar flexors were 4 minus bilaterally .
Coordination showed her to have no strength in the right upper extremity and no tremor but weak on the left upper extremity with finger-to-nose movements .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission included a sodium of l4l , a chloride of l06 , a potassium of 4.3 , a bicarbonate of 26 , and a BUN of l0 .
Creatinine was 0.8 and glucose was 96 .
Otherwise , the SMA 20 was within normal limits .
White count was 5.5 , hematocrit was 43.5 , and MCV was 9l .
Platelet count was 350,000 .
Differential included 66 polys , 24 lymphocytes , 3 monocytes , and l eosinophil .
PT was l3.l and PTT was 30.9 .
Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of l.0l5 , a pH of 8.0 , l+ ketones , and no blood .
Chest X-Ray showed hyperinflation bilaterally and loss of the anterior clear space on the lateral film likely secondary to arm position since the patient was unable to raise up her arm from weakness stemming from her multiple sclerosis .
EKG showed baseline artifacts , sinus tachycardia at l05 , PR interval of 0.l6 , QRS of 0.08 , QT of 0.36 , an axis of 60 degrees , poor R wave progression with transition after the V4 lead , T wave flattening in II and F , and T wave inversion in III .
No old EKG was available for comparison .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) Multiple sclerosis - The patient underwent lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 73 , a protein of 38 , positive oligoclonal bands with an IgG to albumin ratio of 0.485 .
Cell count was l white cell and 5l red cells with a differential of 90 lymphocytes and l0 monocytes in tube number four and two white cells and 600 red cells with a differential of 5 polys , 90 lymphocytes , and 5 monocytes in tube number one .
Patient also had an MRI scan of the head which showed a lesion in the left pons consistent with multiple sclerosis .
Serum IgG was elevated at l,520 .
SPEP showed an elevated gamma spike of l.83 and was otherwise within normal limits .
The patient underwent Lenti Pidesrah Non Community Hospital multiple sclerosis treatment , group II protocol with Cytoxan and ACTH induction with the plan for maintenance Methylprednisolone after discharge .
She tolerated the protocol medications well except for some nausea and vomiting which was relatively well controlled with anti-emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro .
This was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling Foley placed on admission after post-void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine .
She received Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy during the hospitalization .
2) Anemia - Patient had a steady drop in hematocrit from the admission value of 43.5 to the range of about 3l by hospital day number eight which remained stable at this point .
She had guaiac negative stools , no menses , no significant hematuria , and no signs of hemolysis .
Work-up included an iron of l24 , TIBC of 207 , a ferritin of l24 , and Bl2 and folate were pending but unlikely to be contributing to this acute drop .
Haptoglobin was l79 with a normal bilirubin and a normal LDH .
Glucose was 6 , phosphate deficiency was checked with a normal level of 25 being measured , and reticulocyte count of less than 0.l% was noted at one point with follow-up reticulocyte count of 0.l% noted on the day prior to discharge .
This was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly a hematocrit drop secondary to in-hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and p.o. hydration .
Patient did not show coincident decrease in white count or platelet count .
A clot was sent to the Blood Bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion .
She did receive Bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow .
Patient will be followed up with subsequent CBC on the September , the September , the September , and the Septemberth of 2006 to assure that her hematocrit recovers .
3) Urinary tract infection - Patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on 08/15/90 and was thus begun on Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. b.i.d.
Subsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive E. coli , greater than l00,000 including sensitivities to Bactrim .
Patient received a seven day course of Bactrim DS one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture .
Her Foley will be discontinued at discharge and she will continue home straight catheterizations given her post-void residual of 200 cc on admission per the visiting nurse .

Respirations are unlabored at 16 .
HEENT :
Noted for nonicteric sclerae and lungs that are clear to auscultation .
No CVA tenderness was appreciated in the heart and the heart appears to be in regular rate and rhythm .
EXTREMITIES :
Without cyanosis or edema .
ABDOMEN :
Soft and nontender .
SKIN :
Decreased turgor with dry mucous membranes .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count of 7.75 , hematocrit of 46.2% , sodium 144 , potassium 3.9 , creatinine 25 , and BUN was 1.4 with a blood sugar of 88 .
Urinalysis demonstrated 30-50 white blood cells with red blood cells too numerous to count and 2+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of prostate CA , for fluid rehydration .
Initially , the patient was begun on Bactrim for presumptive urinary tract infection and the initial course of his hospitalization , he took p.o.' s poorly .
The patient remained afebrile , however , and his electrolytes were within normal limits .
By hospital day number six , however , the patient became febrile to 100.7 and repeat urinalysis showed 20-30 white blood cells and 1+ bacteria .
Antibiotics were switched to IV Ciprofloxacin and the patient defervesced ; however , by hospital day number seven , the patient was found to be passing very little urine through his condom catheter and electrolyte screen and electrolytes from hospital day number seven showed a BUN of 27 and a creatinine of 2.7 .
The patient was vigorously fluid rehydrated ; however , by hospital day number nine , BUN was 22 , creatinine was 3.5 .
A Foley catheter was placed at that time with the recovery of approximately 800 cc of urine .
Subsequently , the patient began vigorously diuresing with 4 liters urine recovered the following hospital day .
Blood electrolytes were remarkable for a sodium of 148 and a potassium of 5.1 .
The patient 's fluid hydration from D5 one-half normal saline with 20 mEq of K to D5W and acuchecks from this time showed blood sugars routinely between 20 and 50 .
The patient was given one Amp of D50 for each acucheck for blood sugars of less than 40 .
Gradually over the course of the following days , the patient 's electrolytes again normalized ; however , as the patient continues to take p.o.' s poorly , the patient remained on IV hydration therapy .
On hospital day number fourteen , electrolytes were sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , BUN of 11 , creatinine 1.3 with a blood sugar of 125 and a magnesium of 1.9 .
The patient was taking 470 cc of liquid p.o. and is now in stable condition and ready for transfer to El Hospital to continue his recovery .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is transferred to El Hospital , still receiving IV hydration at a rate currently of 50 cc an hour of D5 one-half normal with 20 mEq of K .
Should the patient 's p.o. intake drop to below 500 , the patient should be hydrated at 75 cc/hour .
If the patient 's p.o. intake drop below 300 cc per day , the patient should be hydrated at 100 cc an hour .
The Foley catheter was in place and the Bacitracin ointment should be applied to the urethral meatus twice a day .
Periodic urinalysis should be conducted to monitor the development of possible urinary tract infection .
It should be noted that while in the hospital , the patient received an abdominal ultrasound which is significant for a grossly enlarged liver with multiple foci of cancer .
The patient is discharged on Mylanta 30 cc with meals , Carafate 1 gm q. 6 , Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until the patient regains full activity and IV hydration .
The Foley should be in place until a follow-up appointment with Dr. Aarhalt can be scheduled in approximately one to two weeks at which time a decision regarding the status of the patient 's urinary obstruction will be addressed .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CHORDOMA .
PROCEDURE :
1/22/97 Right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor with laminectomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Marker is a 60 year-old man presented with a two year history with right neck pain .
An initial CT scan was negative , however , eventually a scan in August , 1996 showed a right wedge skull base mass .
In September , 1997 he underwent cerebral angiography complicated by an embolic cerebrovascular accident which presented with confusion in an right homonymous hemianopsia .
He was taken to the Intensive Care Unit .
A follow-up MRI showed low attenuation lesions in both occipital lobes consistent with embolic stroke .
He was treated with aspirin .
November 19 , 1997 , he underwent a resection of a skull base chordoma and a lateral mandibulotomy with tracheostomy .
Postoperatively he had a right true vocal cord paralysis with evidence of aspiration and he therefore received Gelfoam insertion injection into the vocal cord and a PEG was preformed .
He was discharged home with at follow-up MRI and on December 25 , 1997 again revealed a large ill defined lobulated skull based mass with a mass effect on the medulla .
Now preoperatively he reports occasional sharp pains in his right jaw that last about five seconds then resolves as well as loss of his right peripheral vision , difficulty swallowing .
He is taking some liquids p.o. but also has G-tube feedings q.2h.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Status post tonsillectomy , status post appendectomy , status post lumbar fusion remote .
DIET :
Jevity Plus one can q.12h. by G-tube , some liquids .
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to Codeine which causes nausea and Morphine which causes swelling .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Aspirin discontinued in two weeks prior to admission .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Denies use of alcohol and tobacco .
He is married and lives in Nebraska , works as a car dealer , has four grandchildren .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs :
Heart rate 64 , blood pressure 120/80 .
General :
This is a pleasant 60 year-old man whose distressed .
HEENT , normocephalic , atraumatic , well healed right jaw incision , slight swelling right jaw slightly tender to the touch , there is no erythema .
Lungs are clear to auscultation .
Heart regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , gallops or rubs .

Cranial nerves , right visual field deficit , decreased gag , tongue is atrophic and deviates to the right .
Strength five out of five bilateral upper and lower extremities .
Deep tendon reflexes 2+ symmetric , toes downgoing .
Cerebella intact .
Gait steady .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
This 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on Jan 22 , 1997 a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy .
Postoperatively , he was taken to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated .
He was extubated on postoperative day number one .
His neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .
He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating .
He was seen by Physical Therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker .
He noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak .
On postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .
He vomited once and had intermittent headaches .
A head CT was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the C2 level .
A lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours .
A culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .
He was also receiving Ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a Staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both Vancomycin and Ofloxacin .
He was followed by the Speech Pathology Team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration .
A video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .
Because of continuing complaints by Mr. Marker about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .
He underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the Interventional Radiologist on Feb 04 , 1997 .
Prior to admission Mr. Marker had been taking one can of Jevity every two hours as a bolus .
After conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however Mr. Marker did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .
It was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings .
His visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .
His lumbar drain was removed after five days .
He was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .
He is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week .
2) Jevity Plus one can q.2h.
He will have visiting nurse and home Physical Therapy services .
FOLLOW-UP :
Follow-up will be with Dr. Sick in one weeks time .
He will needed a follow-up CT or MRI for the pseudomeningocele .
ADDENDUM
Mr. Marker will be restarted on his preoperative Aspirin as he is now far enough out from his surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1) Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times seven days .

IDENTIFICATION :
Mr. Kotefyfe is a 65-year-old man with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome ( acute myelogenous leukemia ) who presents 20 days status post a nonmyeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplant and is admitted for fatigue , neutropenia , and an abnormal chest x-ray .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
In January 2002 , the patient was found to be anemic .
He was monitored closely and started on folic acid .
In August 2002 , a bone marrow biopsy showed MDS with a 12p abnormality in 14/24 metaphases .
He was treated with 5-azacytidine due to increasing number of blasts .
After four treatment cycles , his marrow remained hypercellular with persistent low levels of blasts .
In September 2004 , the patient converted to AML with Philadelphia chromosome 9:12 and received induction chemotherapy and recovered slowly with blasts .
In November 2005 , a bone marrow biopsy showed 80% cellularity and 40% of the intratrabecular space was composed of AML cells .
Hydrea was started due to splenic pain .
The patient was admitted on December 5 , 2005 for many "" peripheral blood stem cell transplants . ""
This course was without major complications .
Since his discharge from the hospital one week ago , he had twin graft to stem cells .
He has had only a few polys on his white blood cell differential .
He has also had persistent blasts of 1 to 2% .
The patient was taken off GMCSF because of splenic pain and this pain improved .
He has not been febrile .

His white blood cell count and platelet count have been noted to be steadily rising over the past week .
He actually looked a little bit better today than he had previously .
For the past three days , he has been complaining of pain in his shoulder with motion and also a little bit of pain in his left lower quadrant .
A chest x-ray obtained demonstrated a right lobe infiltrate , which was possibly fungal in etiology and the patient has been admitted for further evaluation and treatment .

The remainder of the dictation will be divided by system :
1. Oncology :
The patient is status post nonmyeloablative "" many allogenic bone marrow transplant on 12/12/04 .
Neutrophils have yet twin graft , GMCSF was stopped in a setting of increased splenic pain .
Throughout this admission , the patient has had a climbing level of blasts ( 44% on the day of discharge ) consistent with recurrent leukemic disease .
All immunosuppressants were discontinued except for tacrolimus .
Tacrolimus was continued at a reduced dose to 0.5 mg daily , so that the patient could remain on the GVAX study .
2. ID / Pulmonary :
Admission CAT scans and x-rays of the chest were notable for right upper lobe infiltrate .
The patient was afebrile upon admission and remained afebrile throughout his course .
Infectious Disease and Pulmonary Services were actively involved during this admission .
Both Consultant Services felt the initial imaging was consistent with focal fungal ( question Aspergillus or Mucor ) infiltrates .
He was started empirically .
He was started empirically on Voriconazole .
Given the patient 's history of scrofula , there was mild concern for possible active tuberculosis .
The patient ruled out for TB by serial sputum induction studies .
A bronchoscopy was performed .
Washings , cultures , and viral studies were negative or remained no growth to date .
CMV viral loads were all negative .
Serum galactomannan level on 01/01 was negative .
There was consideration to do a VAT procedure to obtain his definitive diagnosis , but however , in the presence of recurrent leukemic disease , the patient continued to decline this option .
Inpatient antibiotic and antiviral treatment included prophylactic acyclovir and Mepron per protocol , empiric Levaquin , empiric caspofungin , and empiric fluconazole .
The patient does have thrush .
3. Hematology :
The patient had no active bleeding during this admission .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
EPIGLOTTITIS .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is an 87 year old white female who is otherwise healthy by history and presented with a several day history of upper respiratory infection .
Of note , the patient does not smoke and does not drink .
She was seen by her local internist after having several days of blood-tinged sputum which she was coughing up and some mild throat discomfort .
She did not complain of significant pain and was able to tolerate p.o.s.
She denied any respiratory distress although her family thought she may have had some labored breathing at one point .
She was seen by her local physician who was concerned that she may have a malignancy secondary to the history of hemoptysis and throat discomfort .
He recommended that she see a local otolaryngologist .
Examination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had no true record of what was seen .
There was also a question of a carcinomatous lesion on the left side of the epiglottis .
Apparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to Ez Ephtro Health Center where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised .
The patient 's granddaughter , however , works at Retelk County Medical Center and therefore the family elected to bring the patient home and then bring her to Retelk County Medical Center .
She presented to the Emergency Room with some throat discomfort , some mild hoarseness , which she said had been progressing over the last few days .
She was sitting straight upright although was not having any respiratory distress .
She did report a lot of salive in the back of her throat .
She was febrile to 101.7 .
ENT consult was obtained .
A lateral neck film revealed significant swelling of the epiglottis .
ENT examination was then to be performed .
Chest x-ray showed significant kiphosis but otherwise no significant lesions at all .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Negative .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Negative .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :
None .
ALLERGIES :
None .
Smoking none .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Negative .
Alcohol none .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Lives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination .
She had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position .
Her ear examination was normal .
Nasal examination was normal .
Oral cavity was normal .
Neck :
Revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant mass .
Neck :
Otherwise normal and the trachea was midline .
Hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema .
The left pyriform was obliterated by edema .
The right pyriform was narrowed by edema .
The epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx .
The patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis .
There was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area .
Lungs :
Clear .
Heart :
Regular rate and rhythm .
S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits .
No masses .
Extremities :
Normal .
Back :
Showed significant thoracic kiphosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Revealed a WBC count of 11.6 , H and H of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono .
As noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis .
The chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .
She was started on IV Ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .
Due to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the Operating Room emergently for elective intubation .
She was taken to the Operating Room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ENT and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .
The patient was sedated .
Direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct mass or lesion could be noted .
She was transferred to the SICU where she was kept sedated and was given Ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as IV steroids for the first 24 hours consisting of Decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. X 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the Emergency Room on the way down to the Operating Room .
Her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .
At the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .
Her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed .
She had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 .
She was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .
EKG and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree AV block that she had had on her preoperative EKG but no other findings at all .
She continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .
Her blood gases and O2 saturations correlated well and we used O2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good O2 saturation .
She was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated .
She went into an SVT the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to Digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 .
She continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of SVT and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that .
Her edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both 4/3 and 4/4 revealed decreasing edema .
On 4/5/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems .
She was kept on Ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given .
Examination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold .
Otherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .
Of note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .
Once the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .
Tube feedings were started on 4/3/91 and the NG tube was discontinued on 4/5/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .
After extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .
Again , MI was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .
O2 saturations looked good .
It was felt that this was a mild episode of ICU psychosis .
She was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway .
She was maintained on Ceftriaxone and then switched to Augmentin and remained afebrile .
Her white counts came down .
Blood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .
She had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .
Cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all Digoxin and just watched and that her SVTs may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .
Unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .
Nonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of Digoxin and had no further problems with her heart .
Her mental status began to clear under the family 's request .
DISPOSITION :
On 4/9/91 she was sent home on a week of Augmentin and will followup in the ENT Clinic .
Our plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .
She , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .
If she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy .
Discharge medications are Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. X 7 days .
The patient is to followup in the ENT Clinic in approximately one week .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 111y year old female who presented initially to the Medical service on 05/01 complaining of weight loss , nausea , vomiting and abdominal distention .
She reported that she was remarkably healthy until the latter part of 12/93 , when her granddaughter noticed her to be jaundiced .
Since that time she had yellow colored stools .
On 01/24 she was taken to the Rys Memorial Hospital hospital , where she was diagnosed with choledocholithiasis .
An ERCP showed stones in the common bile duct but they could not be recovered .
Therefore she was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center and admitted there from 01/25 - 02/03 .
An ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
The distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .
The stones were then removed .
The distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .
She was discharged home .
Approximately one month prior to admission she developed anorexia , increased abdominal girth , weight loss of 15 lb , and nausea and vomiting .
She presented to the emergency room , where a nasogastric tube was placed and drained approximately 400 of green-brown , thick fluid .
She was admitted for workup of her symptoms .

KUB :
Large , approximately 30 cm stomach filled with fluid .
Chest x-ray :
clear lungs .
EKG :
left bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at 90 , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Gastroenterology service and it was decided that an esophagogastroduodenoscopy would be performed .
Prior to this study , however , a CT examination of the abdomen was obtained which showed a mass in the porta causing biliary ductal dilatation proximally and gastric outlet obstruction .
On 05/05 an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed , which showed gastric outlet obstruction , a deformed pylorus and a duodenal mass encasing and obstructing the lumen .
It appeared that there was a large tumor mass obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .
The General Surgery service was involved at this stage , and on 05/08 a posterior gastrojejunostomy with wedge liver biopsy was performed to facilitate gastric drainage .
Pathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .
The patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .
However , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .
It was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools clay colored .
After discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .
The patient 's subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .
She complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .
As she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .
The best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .

PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE BREAST .
OTHER PROBLEMS :
1. HYPONATREMIA , 1-13-94 .
2. PULMONARY EMBOLUS , 1-14-94 .
3. DIARRHEA , NAUSEA AND VOMITING , FEVER .
4. HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .
She was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .
The patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .
A mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .
However , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .
Fine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .
Staging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .
Bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .
Dr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .
The right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .
The margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .
Furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .
The left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .
Estrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .
The patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .
Therefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .
Since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .
The patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .
There were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .
However , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .
ABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .
Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .
The differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .
Basically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .
Although she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .
She was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .
Complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .
She also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .
It was treated with gent and Cipro .
Re-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .
In May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .
In mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .
The patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .
She has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .
We will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia .
UTIs , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster .

She had menarche at age 15 .
She used the pill for five years in the past .
She is G 2 , P 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries .
She has a history of easy bruis ability .
She is allergic to Augmentin which gives her a rash .
MEDICATIONS :

She worked as an occupational therapist at a professional center for handicapped children .
She denies tobacco and drug use and drinks ethanol socially .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
A cachectic white female .
T 100.1 , P 104 , blood pressure 130/90 , heart rate of 16 , she was sating 95% on room air .
HEENT - Pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light .
Neck - Tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly .
Lungs were clear .
Chest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus .
Cardiovascular - Normal .
Abdomen - Normal .
There was no HSM .
Extremities - Her left arm was very swollen .
It was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .
There was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .
Neuro - The patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .
She also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .
Cranial nerves II - XII were grossly intact .
Toes were downgoing .
LABORATORY DATA :
Of note - Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .
PT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .
ALT was elevated at 240 , AST 85 , LDH 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 .
Cholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .
UA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .
Chest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .
In summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .
The Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .
When she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .
So she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .
Also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .
She refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .
Another major issue with this patient was pain control .
She had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .
So pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .
One of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .
After that the patient had minimal relief of pain .
However , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .
So accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .
She is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .
She is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .
We can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .
Other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .
We went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .
In addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .
That has been stable .
The patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .
Her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .
A renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .
We proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .
We had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .
In addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.
So that has really improved .
We suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .
On the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton 's hump .
Also a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .
So we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.
Her INR is 2.3 .
We want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .
So if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .
However , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .
Other major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .
We put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .
So on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .
If needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .
The patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .
She is also a little dry .
The patient is on oxygen .
Ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .
She was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .
We would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .
The complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .
DISPOSITION :
Discharge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Fair .
She remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .
She is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care .
Follow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .
The appointment has already been made .
The patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .

HISTORY OF PRESEnt ILLNESS :
The patient is a 67 year old white male with ahistory of a heart murmur .
In September of 1996 his wife noted increasing episodes of forgetfulness .
A work up was instituted which revealed a head CT which showed changes consistent with age .
He underwent a cardiac catheterization on 12/6/96 which revealed clean coronary arteries with a band-like obstruction of the origin of the right coronary artery from 3+ aortic insufficiency .
There was a dilated aortic aneurysm including the sinus and ascending aorta .
The patient therefore presents with composite aortic root replacement .
He underwent an abdominal ultrasound which showed a dilated aorta distally , measuring 2.6 x 3 cm .

He is scheduled to undergo a composite aortic root replacement .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted on 12/11/96 .
He was seen by the dental service preoperatively who cleared him for surgery , as he had no evidence of acute oral infection .
On 12/12/96 the patient was taken to the operating room where he underwent a composite aortic root replacement .
postoperatively , he was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
he was given Vancomycin IV for perioperative prophylactic antibiotics .
By postoperative day 1 he was extubated and was stable enough for discharge to the regular floor .
He was placed on Coumadin postoperatively as well as digoxin and Lopressor .
His mental status changes remained stable from their perioperative baseline and he was continued on his Haldol .
He was in atrial fibrillation postoperatively but his rate was well controlled on digoxin and Lopressor .
His chest tubes were all removed by postoperative day 3 .
He was placed on Coumadin given the presence of the persistent atrial fibrillation and it is thought that he would only need short term anticoagulation for approximately 3 months .

Heart rate was 78 , blood pressure 98/50 , respiratory rate of 32 , satting 91% on four liters .
In general , this is an obese male in mild respiratory distress .
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy .
HEENT - normocephalic / atraumatic , extraocular movements are intact , pupils equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation .
Chest had diffuse crackles bilaterally halfway up .
Coronary - irregular PVCs , S1 , S2 normal , positive systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border radiating throughout .

No clubbing or cyanosis .
Neurologic examination - alert and oriented x 3 , slurred and slow speech , distractable .

LABORATORY DATA :
White blood count 4.36 , hematocrit 26.1 with platelets of 107,000 , MCV 81 .
Sodium 137 , potassium 4.5 , chloride97 , bicarb 24 , BUN 124 , creatinine 4.1 , glucose 144 , AST 49 , ALT33 , alkaline phosphatase 253 , total bili 1.6 , calcium 9.2 , magnesium 2.3 , albumin 3.4 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Gastrointestinal .
The patient had an elevated bilirubin on admission with decreased output of biliary drain .
The drain was replaced over the wire , 8-10 by IR , when it was accidentally removed .
Increased flow again .
The patient had signs and symptoms develop of SBP , also with an elevated white count .
He was treated broadly with amp , levo and Flagyl .
Cultures were negative and onlyon one gram stain did it show rare gram negative rods .
The patient 's abdominal fluid cell counts showed 2400 white blood cells , 500 red cells with 82 polyps , 11 lymphs , 7 monos .
Clinically , this was consistent with SBP , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer .
He underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic .
This had to be performed by IR because the pocket was too deep to access from the bedside .
He received a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics and will be maintained on Levofloxacin IV for prophylaxis against SBP .
2. Pulmonary .
From a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath .
His apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved .
Chest xray was consistent with pleurodesis .
However , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and Lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids .
On the day of discharge , he is stating approximately 91 to 92% on three to four liters .
Chest xray is still consistent with volume overload .
The plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and Lasix to mobilize his fluid .
3. Cardiovascular .
He had episodes of bradycardia without subsequent fall in blood pressure at the beginning of his admission .
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
Echocardiogram showed 50% ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation .
He did not show any episodes of bradycardia throughout the remainder of his hospital course .
4. Endocrine .
Diabetes .
His Avandia was discontinued secondary to the side effect profile .
He is being maintained on glipizide and sliding scale insulin .
5. Heme .
From a heme standpoint , he presented anemic and with an elevated PT INR .
He required a few transfusions during his hospital course .
He also required FFP initially to reverse his coagulopathy .
However , this resolved on its own over the hospital course .
His INR normalized , however , unfortunately , he developed bilateral deep venous thromboses during his hospital course and will be maintained on Lovenox .
6. Renal .
He had a creatinine of 4.0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid , currently at 1.7 on discharge .
From his urinalysis , he has mostly a prerenal state .
However , he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state .
At the time , Nutrition was following , initially with a low fat , low cholesterol , low sugar diet .
His appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses , therefore , we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes .
7. ID .
Please see GI .
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a 14 day course for clinical SBP .
He will be maintained on Levofloxacin for prophylaxis against SBP .
Given that he will need continued taps,
8. Oncology .
The patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy .
However , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and I do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him .
His pain here has been controlled , initially on Oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain .
As he becomes progressively more somnolent , this will likely need to be switched to IV pain medications only .
Discussion , at that point in time , should occur with the family about comfort measures and about weaning him from his medications to make him more comfortable .
Code status - the patient is a DNR / DNI .
This is an unfortunate case but Mr. Po does have an incredibly supportive family who have been here consistently to visit him and that offers him an important source of comfort .

She had recently completed a cycle of gemcitabine and Taxotere .
Her primary oncologist felt that she was end-stage , but the patient and her family were questioning for additional treatment .
She was seen at Carmoaksfearwhit Hospital for regular follow up to check her cell counts .
She was found at that time to have possible cellulitis and was admitted for this as well as out of concern that she had had many falls at home and did not have services .
The patient reported noticing redness on her left hand incidentally the morning of admission and denied any fevers or cuts .
The hand was nontender .
Her most recent fall was the day prior to admission , and she did not hit her head .

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
The patient was admitted for intravenous antibiotics for possible cellulitis of the right hand .
She was initially given Ancef IV .
She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the second day of her admission due to hypercarbic respiratory distress .
Her blood gas at that time was PH 7.26 , bicarb 93 , oxygen 70 , chest x-ray was felt to be consistent with fluid overload .
There was also a question of left lower lobe infiltrate and effusion .
She was also covered with levofloxacin empirically for pneumonia .
She was started on nasal BiPAP and repeat arterial blood gas on the BiPAP was PH 7.26 , PCO2 1.11 , and PO2 157 .
Her code status was visited with her family .
They felt the cause of her dyspnea was potentially reversible , and that she would want aggressive management at that time .
1. Respiratory :
The patient was intubated with goal of decreasing her PCO2 .
This was accomplished and her arterial blood gas improved PH 7.49 , PCO2 58 , and PO2 242 .
She had abronchoscopy on 09/18/2004 which revealed a left lower lobe basal segment tumor versus mucous plug versus edematous versus foreign body aspiration .
The patient self-extubated on 09/20/2004 and was maintained on intermittent noninvasive positive pressure ventilation until the time of her death .
2. Cardiovascular :

3. Comfort :
The patient was agitated and uncomfortable throughout much of her intensive care unit stay .
It was difficult to both keep her comfortable and maintain adequate respiratory drive .
Her pulmonary status gradually worsened throughout her intensive care stay after her self-extubation on 09/20/2004 .
Reintubation was not desired by the patient or the family .
Her code status was DNR .
She developed rattling in her trachea audible without a stethoscope on 09/24/2004 , was poorly arousable , and had a venous PCO2 of 103 .
She was more awake that afternoon , was able to interact somewhat with her family .
However , in light of her suffering and terminal condition , her family elected to discontinue the use of neosynephrine .
The patient died on 09/25/2004 at 12:49 a.m.
Death was pronounced by Dr. Ilon Cale .
The family was offered and declined a postmortem examination .

Her Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT , but was otherwise unremarkable .
The patient had a normal B12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization .
She was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days Coumadin was started .
Her exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day .
Her pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge .
She needs to be given 5 mg of Coumadin tonight , 5/22/92 .
In addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour .
It is discontinued at the time of transport .
The patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete .
During evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate .
On our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown .
There are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen .
At the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient 's family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital .
What follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia .
Her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain .
Moreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions .
Our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast Ca .
As I mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time .
While mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head .
Two possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody .
These tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge .
The results can be obtained by paging me , Do A. Joasscchird , M.D. at 834-364-2251 .
I will be happy to furnish the results .
The patient has a history of MI in 1989 .
Echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities .
EKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q/wave inversion .
We would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .
Persantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .
The patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .
It has been evaluated in the past without success .
During her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .
Studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .
Studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal .
This is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .
Florinef is to be considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal .
The patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .
In addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection .
This has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .
CT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings .
A chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding .
A PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday , 4 26th .
The left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa .
The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of Coumadin .
Dopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission .
It is doubtful that she has chronic PE , but this is one consideration .
It is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration .
The patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 .
We think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic .
This can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time .
The patient has glaucoma .
Her medications are as listed below .
Her ophthalmologist is aware of transfer .
His name is Ettrent Can and he can be reached at 678-233-5033 , b 549 .

The patient had an ileostomy performed and had had her first course of chemotherapy and later debulking operation by Dr. Median .
She was well at home until 8:30 p.m. on the day of admission , when she developed acute onset of right foot pain , which was worse with walking .
She complained of increased numbness of the right foot over time , and was seen at Sephsandpot Center , where she was found to have palpable right femoral and popliteal pulses , and no pedal pulses .
The patient was transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
She had previous history of claudication .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for glaucoma , right knee arthroscopic surgery in 1988 , appendectomy , dilation and curettage times two , and a hiatus hernia .

DISCHARGE DATE :
02-01-92 The patient is an 80 year old right-handed female who is a nun whose admission to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on the 11th was the first for her .
She was admitted with a subarachnoid hemorrhage presumed to have occurred nine days prior to admission .
She was admitted with confusion and a left internal carotid artery aneurysm present on MR angiogram .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
On 01/03/92 the patient was noted to have nausea and a marked increase in her mild baseline confusion of several years duration .
She was transferred to a facility at Atl Mil , Maryland in Oakwest on 01/10/92 with a headache , nausea and worsening confusion as well as incomprehensible speech .
She was not able to follow commands and had a low grade temperature with a question of a right facial droop .
She was then transferred to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home where a lumbar puncture revealed a few red blood cells and white blood cells but also showed marked xanthochromia .
She did not reveal any meningismus .
The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and referred under the care of Dr. Telshey Peg by Dr. Rerhea T. Hearing of Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
includes hypertension , cataract od. , urinary incontinence x 2 years and hearing aids .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
includes coronary artery bypass grafting in 08/91 in the Ona Hospital .
Apparently the patient has had no angina or congestive heart failure since .
Bilateral knee replacements in 1973 .
Carpal tunnel releases in 1982 and 1965.
cholecystectomy in 1967 .
Hysterectomy in 1952 .
Right heart biopsy in 1990 which was benign .
FAMILY HISTORY :
was noncontributory .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
included Percocet , Tenormin , Xanax , Mevacor and with a history of of Calan , Ornade and Lasix .
ALLERGIES :
There were no known drug allergies .
HABITS :
did not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only .
Chest was clear .
Heart had regular rate and rhythm .
Neck was supple without mass or bruits .
The abdomen was soft and nontender .
Calves were nontender .
On neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation .
She looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time .
Her face was strong and symmetric .
She felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically .
Her extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus .
She sees light only od. which is chronic .
She reads large print os.
Her tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically .
She could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift .
She also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees .
Her grip is 5/5 bilaterally .
Ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , MCV 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 .
A head CT performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood .
MRA / MRI revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 .
This revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left .
This was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
The internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis .
After much discussion , endovascular treatment with GD coils were recommended .
The patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 .
This showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils .
One coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
It was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe .
Also the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism .
Therefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil .
Therefore after discussion in detail with Sister Rora Dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 .
At this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic .
Therefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm .
The patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name .
Her pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed .
Her consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
subarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
PROCEDURES :
On 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram .
01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm .
COMPLICATIONS :
There were no noted complications .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
include heparin 5000 units sq. b.i.d. , MOM 30 cc. p.o. q. hs. , Dulcolax 10 mg. p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. , Tenormin 50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Calan 60 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , Omeprazole 20 mg. p.o.q.d. , Lasix 20 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chloride 40 mEq. p.o. b.i.d. , Dilantin 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Lotrimin to groin t.i.d. , Droperidol .625 mg. po 1.25 mg. m. q. 6 p.r.n. , Dulcolax 1 pr. q.d. p.r.n. , Tylenol 975 mg. q. 6 p.r.n. and CZI sliding scale b.i.d.
The patient has increased her p.o. intake however given her uncertain p.o. intake the patient was not started on a p.o. antidiabetic regimen .
Therefore we suggest a fasting blood sugar q.d. for several days after discharge .
If the fasting blood sugar remains greater than 160 we would have the local M.D. consider starting the patient on p.o. medications such as Glyburide .
This may include Tolinase at 100 mg. p.o. q. am .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
FOLLOW UP :
The patient is to follow up with Dr. Telshey Peg .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Warm is an 83 year old man with chronic congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization .
Over the last four to five months , Mr. Warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily PND and orthopnea .
He has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator .
Although in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery .
The patient lives independently with his wife in Connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately .
He has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising .
He does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
On examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age .
His blood pressure was 110/70 .
Heart was 82 and regular .
Respiratory rate was 16 .
His jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ .
Lungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales .
The first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced .
There was an S3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla .
The abdomen was soft and nontender .
There was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex .
The extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused .
The posterior tibialis pulses were intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 .
Albumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , white count 8.6 , platelets 388 and PT 12.6 seconds .
The chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion .
The ECG was paced .
An outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 mms. , an LV of 60 mms. , ejection fraction of 26% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , an ejection fraction of 26% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis .
There was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated RV peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared .
The aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of Mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared .
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals .
Left ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% .
There was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views .
In addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself .
The patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications .
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Win Shufffyfe of the Cardiac Surgery Service and after a long discussion with the patient , Dr. Shufffyfe and the patient 's family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient 's age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease .
While in hospital , the patient was seen by Lenni Breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest .
The patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% .
The patient was fitted with a CPAP apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient .
In addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night .
At the time of discharge , the patient 's vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs .
He will be followed both by Dr. Warm closely upon return to his son 's home in Connecticut and by Gie Lung of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Partners Home Care Program .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Pulmonary edema .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Congestive heart failure , coronary artery disease , mediastinal mass , inferior myocardial infarction , bronchiectasis .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
None .
CLINICAL INFECTIONS :
None .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Cardiac catheterization .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
VQ scan , lower extremities noninvasive Doppler studies and overnight oximetry saturation monitoring .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. State is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema .
In the setting of inadvertently decreasing Lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day Mr. State had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .
Upon arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. State 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .
Chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the Emergency Room as noted .
The patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of .9 and FVC of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in May , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an LVID of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .
In addition , Mr. State has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .
His cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .
The patient lives on Quelene with his wife .
He is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .
Blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 .
Mr. State was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen .
Jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent .
There was no thyromegaly .
Carotids were 2+ .
Breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with Gallavardin like radiation to the apex .
Abdomen :
soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations .
There was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .
The urinalysis was negative .
The Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .
Chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .
After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .
Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .
Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .
It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .
After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .
Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .
In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .
His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .
Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .
At a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. State 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .
The patient will be followed by Dr. State within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Bridge is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema .
In the setting of inadvertently decreasing Lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day Mr. Bridge had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .
Upon arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. Bridge 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .
Chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the Emergency Room as noted .
The patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of .9 and FVC of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in December , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an LVID of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .
In addition , Mr. Bridge has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .
His cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .
The patient lives on Ewi with his wife .
He is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .
Blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 .
Mr. Bridge was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen .
Jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent .
There was no thyromegaly .
Carotids were 2+ .
Breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with Gallavardin like radiation to the apex .
Abdomen :
soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations .
There was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .
The urinalysis was negative .
The Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .
Chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .
After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .
Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .
Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .
It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .
After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .

The patient was in a good state of health until January of 1993 when she developed a serious upper respiratory tract infection associated with weakness and fatigue .
She had also reported a weight loss of 15 pounds over the past two months .
Although her upper respiratory tract infection seemed to be resolving , her weakness persisted .
A work up begun by her internist , Dr. Brain , revealed a white blood cell count of 49,000 with 50% eosinophils .
She was admitted to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home for further evaluation .
Data collected there included a chest x-ray which was unremarkable .
The liver function tests showed an alkaline phosphatase of 303 , LDH 310 , SGOT 66 , albumin 2.5 .
A peripheral blood smear showed mature eosinophils in increased numbers .
Chromosomal studies were negative .
A bone scan showed increased uptake at the manubrium at the site of an old fracture , as well as in the right supraclavicular area .
A thyroid ultrasound showed an inferior thyroid mass .
This was followed by an abdominal CT which showed an enlarged spleen , a lytic lesion on the right iliac bone and a benign renal cyst .
Biopsy of the lytic lesion was consistent with metastases papillary carcinoma of the thyroid .
An upper gastrointestinal was unremarkable .
The small bowel follow through was within normal limits .
A thyroid scan revealed decreased function and displacement of the thyroid by a cold mass located inferiorly with calcifications on the right side .
A chest CT also revealed a small pulmonary nodule with a necrotic mass involving the right lung posteriorly .
The patient was subsequently referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital under the service of Dr. Brain .
She continued to have profound weakness , a decreased appetite and weight loss .
She also developed lower extremity edema as well as left upper extremity swelling associated with increased shortness of breath on exertion .
A needle biopsy of the right thyroid nodule showed papillary thyroid carcinoma .

She had a 3 x 4 cm firm , nontender right thyroid mass that seemed to be fixed to the trachea .
She had no jugular venous distention or bruits .
The lungs exhibited right basilar dullness one quarter of the way up .
She had no definite S3 .
The liver edge was palpable to 6 cm below the right costal margin .
Her spleen could not be palpated .
She had 4+ edema to the knees bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission the white blood count was 67.3 with a differential of 21% polys , 16% bands , 3% lymphocytes , 2% monocytes , 57% eosinophils and 1% myelocytes .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Dr. Shatermivaet S Brain on 4/28/93 with a history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with bone involvement and possible lung involvement .
Work up was begun for the possible myeloproliferative / myelodysplastic disorder associated with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome .
Accordingly , an Oncology consult was called on 4/29/93 and a bone marrow aspirate biopsy was performed .
This revealed maturation of leukocytes to all stages with markedly increased eosinophilic proliferation .
A lung biopsy was performed on 4/30/93 without definitive results .
During this time the patient 's coagulation status had improved with Vitamin K therapy with PTs normalizing .
ANCA serum results were negative .
ANA results were also nonsuggestive .
The patient continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a Vascular Radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein .
There was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well .
A head CT was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain .
Thus , a heparin sliding scale was begun .
Meanwhile , the patient 's eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone .
She also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to Bactrim , but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea .
The conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist , as well as the bone pathologist , were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases .
Dr. Trial was subsequently consulted on 5/5 for surgical intervention .
On 5/6/93 the patient underwent a right thyroidectomy with sacrifice of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as the right sternothyroid muscle and lower parathyroid gland .
She underwent autotransplantation of the right upper parathyroid gland , as well as repair of a right posterior membranous tracheotomy .
She was received in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit immediately postoperatively in stable condition .
Her rate was well controlled on Digoxin .
The patient was transferred to the floor on 5/7 .
On the ward she continued a gentle diuresis as well as Solu-Medrol therapy .
Calcium levels remained 7.2 to 7.5 postoperatively .
She continued to improve with a slight hoarseness in her voice that was expected .
She continued to exhibit asymptomatic atrial fibrillation .
Anticoagulation was begun on the third postoperative day with Coumadin .
She was effectively anticoagulated with a PT in the range between 15 and 17 over a control of 10 .
She also received a Radiation Therapy consult for local control of her invasive carcinoma .
She did well on the ward and was discharged on her ninth postoperative day .

When the patient came to the floor he was angry and upset about admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital instead of the Bridges Hospital and was somewhat combative .
He admitted to drinking 1 pint or so of alcohol not every day but the last drink was the night prior to admission to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and he had a couple of glasses of wine .
He was quite confused in relaying the history and very tangential in his replies .
He says he was out to lunch some friends to eat pizza at a restaurant on Valemin .
He decided to go to the basemen so they could eat in privacy when he was hit over the head by police with a gun and lost consciousness at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward .
He was quite paranoid , agitated and delusional during an interview and there is no evidence to support the patient 's history and recall of events leading to the hospitalization .
Hospital course by system .
1. NEUROLOGICALLY :
The patient is completely alert , awake and oriented x 3 .
The patient shows no evidence of alcohol withdrawal although he was prophylactically treated with Ativan and was given multivitamins , thiamine and folate .
Psychiatry saw the patient and felt that he was suffering from alcohol related syndrome versus some component of pugilist brain given the fact that he was a boxer in the past .
They felt that there was no acute psychiatric issue at hand .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :

He deserves a full syncope as an inpatient and is stable for transfer from a cardiovascular standpoint .
This will be pursued at the Bridges Hospital .
He is maintained on his antihypertensive of Lisinopril and his anti-hyperlipidemic of Gemfibrozil and gets an aspirin .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Aspirin 325 mg per day .
2. Gemfibrozil 600 mg twice a day .

11 ) Epogen q. two weeks .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Negative for tobacco , negative for alcohol .
The patient lives alone , but in a senior living facility adjacent to friends .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Cardiovascular :
The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
She remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .
The patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .
The patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix .
The patient 's Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm .
The patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .
At this time , the patient 's presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .
2 ) Neurological / vascular :
The discrepancy in the patient 's pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .
The patient underwent MRI / MRA of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .
The left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .
The patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA .
MRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct .
The patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease .
The patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .
The results of these studies suggested that the patient 's symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .
A Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient 's intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .
3 ) Orthopedic :
The patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .
Outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view .
Repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new .
An Orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with Physical Therapy assistance .
A bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative .
At the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of Physical Therapy and a walker .
Plans were made for the patient to be discharged to Dwardmegriff Rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture .
4 ) Gastrointestinal :
The patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted .
The patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation .
The patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement .
However , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently .
The patient 's emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood .
The etiology of the patient 's nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract .
The patient was started on Meclizine on December 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo .
An attempt was also made to reduce the patient 's large number of medications and the patient 's Os-Cal , multivitamin , Lasix and Colace were discontinued .
5 ) Infectious disease :
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on December 30 , 2000 .
Urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection .
The patient was started on Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection .
The urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation .
6 ) Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The patient had a mild increase in her BUN and creatinine during her hospitalization which promptly returned to her baseline levels with intravenous fluids .
The patient was encouraged to increase her p.o. intake .

Admission Date :
09/16/2000
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
11/03/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
RUPTURED PARATHYROID ADENOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Shuffa is a 73-year-old Portuguese speaking woman who was transferred via Med Flight to Verg Medical Center .
She arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm .
She initially presented to Brottlake Medical Center on 9/15/00 complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids .
While she was in Brottlake Medical Center , she developed new onset stridor , and an ENT consult was obtained .
They attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway .
She was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest .
Given these findings , she underwent a CT scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus .
This raised concerns for a hemorrhage , and she was transferred to Verg Medical Center emergently .
At the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center , she underwent an emergent CT scan with IV contrast .
This revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm .
However , it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma .
She was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service under the care of Dr. Sccrookes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Severe hypertension , angina , GERD , peptic ulcer disease , status post Billroth II , ovarian cancer , status post TAH-BSO in 1987 with a negative second look laparotomy in 1988 , chronic anemia , chronic left ear infection .
MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION :
Celexa 10 mg p.o. q.d.; Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Capoten 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Cardizem 180 mg p.o. q.d.; Xanax 0.5 mg tabs .
On transfer , she was on her preadmission medications plus Unasyn and Tigan 250 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is divorced and retired .
She lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is intubated .
VITAL SIGNS :
Temperature 98.6 , 66 .
Right arm was 180/80 , left 188/72 , and A-line was 151/61 .
Tidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10 , 10 of pressure support , and 10 of PEEP , and 100% FiO2 , satting 100% .
GENERAL :
She was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities .
NECK :
Edematous .
Trachea was midline .
She had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck .
The superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts .
She had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region .
Her anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis .
LUNGS :
She had bilateral expiratory wheezes .
ABDOMEN :
Soft with good bowel sounds .
It was nontender .
It was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant .
Both were easily reducible .
PULSE :
On the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial .
LABORATORY DATA :
CBC was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 .
Coags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 .
Her gas was 7.47/40/332 .
Electrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block .
CT scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air .
It was consistent with a hematoma .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Ms. Shuffa underwent an EGD and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived .
This showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time .
She was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator .
The differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor .
On 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy .
A biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma .
The operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot .
There was no active bleeding at the time .
Over the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator .
She had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma .
The ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level .
Given these findings , she underwent a Sestamibi scan .
The Sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid .
At this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma .
Dr. Ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 .
She underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy .
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with her new tracheostomy working well .
Her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left .
This required a chest tube .
Her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding .
It was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest .
However , we are not quite sure why this was occurring .
She underwent an extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology .
It turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology .
In conclusion , by systems :
1. Neuro .
The patient became intermittently agitated .
We have been giving her Haldol at bedtime as well as Ativan p.r.n. throughout the day .
She responds well to this .
She speaks some English and seems to understand more than she speaks .
She has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day .
She has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that Ms. Shuffa is in good spirits .
2. Cardiac .
The patient 's blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic .
This is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d. as well as Diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d. She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .
For this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine .
Her blood pressure responds well to this .
Otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .
The patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter .
This has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center .
Dr. Lenni Lung has been consulted .
The aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .
They elected not to inject it with thrombin .
They asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .
They have opted for conservative management given the size .
3. Respiratory .
At the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .
She seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100% on 40% FIO2 .
Her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .
Her right lung field is clear .
Her tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it .
She will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated .
We had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week .
With the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 .
Her oxygen saturation has always been good .
4. GI .
The patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour .
This is her goal .
She tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day .
Last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day .
Stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin .
These have all been negative .
We believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .
Since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .
She has been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .
5. GU .
The patient has had hypernatremia .
She is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight .
We believe her to still be total body overloaded .
Over the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube .
We also have been diuresing her with Bumex .
This seems to trend her sodium down .
This will need to be monitored closely .
Her BUN and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine .
6. Heme .
As stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation .
She had an extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin .
Before we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets .
She had no problems with this .
At the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range .
I stress that she cannot be anticoagulated .
We have given her Lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed .
Therefore , she is on no DVT prophylaxis .
She does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis .
She has a Greenfield filter in place , and this is her only DVT prophylaxis .
7. ID .
At the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection .
She is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures .
Interestingly enough , she also has Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum .
This is also sensitive only to Macrodantin .
We do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time .
She is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. for a ten day course .
Her Foley was changed the day before discharge .
8. Tubes , lines , and drains .
The patient has a tracheostomy , NG tube , and a Foley catheter .
Her central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Albuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and Atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg q.4h. , please alternate albuterol and Atrovent ; Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg per NG tube q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 mg per NG tube q.i.d.; vitamin B12 1000 mcg IM q. month , next dose is due Nov 18 ; diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; ferrous sulfate 300 mg per NG t.i.d.; Haldol 5 mg IV q.h.s.; hydralazine 10 mg IV q.6h. p.r.n. hypertension ; lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d.; Ativan 1 mg per NG tube q.h.s.; Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; Zantac 150 mg per NG tube b.i.d.; multivitamin 10 ml per NG tube q.d.; Macrodantin 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. x 10 days beginning on 11/3/00 .

ANGIOSARCOMA
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
POOR
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Fever , abdominal pain and vomiting .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Riie Pruesschird is a 25 year-old gentleman with metastatic angiosarcoma who presents as a transfer from Nacalv Medical Center with a fever to 101 , vomiting times one and "" left kidney pain "" .
This patient is an unfortunate young gentleman who was initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of 1997 after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of DEP therapy for pulmonary involvement .
In the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation .
In early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in February of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and Adriamycin for six cycles .
In 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis .
In early 2000 he was started on therapy with Taxol per Dr. Azel Hibbskays and finished this in March of this year .
CT imaging at that time was negative for disease .
In April of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side .
Thereafter he began chemotherapy with Taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 .
Most recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the Pointexasp Region General Hospital on 06/16/00 .
That hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus .
He was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( TPA ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight Heparin .
It was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization .
Finally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to Pre Health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation .
Mr. Pruesschird returns tonight after being found to have a temperature of 101 , last evening and early this morning in addition to nausea , vomiting times one earlier today .
As well he has complained of some vague left abdominal / flank pain that he attributes to "" kidney pain "" .
He was given Flagyl and had already apparently been on Levofloxacin at the outside hospital since his recent discharge for questionable pneumonia .
Mr. Pruesschird denies headaches , chest pain and any change in his breathing or comfort with breathing .
He denies persistent vomiting , abdominal pain , other than as mentioned , new skin changes or diarrhea .

RIEFF , ALB P
UNIT NUMBER :
185-64-30
ADMISSION DATE :
08/24/1998
DISCHARGE DATE :
09/14/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Sternal wound infection .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Infected aortic graft .
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
08/31/98 ascending aortic root replacement with homograft with omentopexy .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
09/02/98 sternal debridement .
Bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flap .
Right superiorly based rectus abdominis flap .
Primary closure of wound .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a history of an ascending aortic graft replacement in 1991 for aortic dissection .
At that time the patient 's hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap .
The patient was then continued by report on Dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation .
The patient apparently did well until June 1998 when he noted a bulge in his sternal area .
A ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired .
The patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired .
However the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma .
By report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and pain control at the outside hospital .
However the patient was then subsequently transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital upon request of the family on 8/24/98 for further evaluation and possible intervention .
The patient was evaluated by Dr. Rhalt of Dentvailr. Medical Center .
As the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .
There was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .
At the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous Unasyn to Levofloxacin for what appeared to be Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures .
Subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside .
Given all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .
The patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .
The patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .
He did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Thoracic aneurysm repair .
2. Hypertension .
3. Status post hernia repair .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day .
2. Captopril 75 mg po three times a day .
3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .
4. Hydralazine 12.5 mg four times per day .
5. Reglan 10 mg po three times a day .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Noncontributory .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient was married and denied any tobacco or alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile , vital signs were stable .
Head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam :
negative .
Neck was supple .
There was no jugular venous distention .
2+ carotids without bruits .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 diastolic ___ and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles .
Extremities :
the patient had 2+ femoral pulses and 1+ pedal pulses .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Sodium 137 , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen 16 , creatinine .9 , white blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 29.7 , platelet count 207 .
The patient 's preoperative chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient 's sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Service under Dr. Rhalt .
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit given the patient 's precarious condition .
Over the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier .
The patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service as well as the Cardiology Service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension .
The patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service for potential sternal reconstruction .
After lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft .
This was obtained on 08/30/98 by Dr. Niste Rhalt of the Cardiac Surgical Service .
The patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection .
The procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest .
The aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein .
The cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes .
The graft used was a homograft .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open .
The immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum .
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
There he continued to be hemodynamically stable .
Of note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent .
In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .
On that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .
A number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .
The patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
At this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin .
The Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for Crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters .
Over the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties .
The patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , Captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as Procardia .
The patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control .
Subsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient Service .
The patient continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that the patient 's Jackson Pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them .
As per the Infectious Disease Service the patient was continued on Levofloxacin , Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage .
However on 09/08/98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius .
Given this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well .
The patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics .
This was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty .
At the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen .
He was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well .
He continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable .
On postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger .
Subsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service .
The patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .
The patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .
These drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient .
Prior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .
The patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress .
As a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation .
The patient 's condition continued to be improved .
Given this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 .
In consultation with the Infectious Disease Service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
Diet :
High calorie , high protein .
The patient 's treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks .
The patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by Occupational Therapy Services Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
The patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger .
The patient on discharge is to have twice weekly Vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term Vancomycin therapy .
The patient was instructed to return to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema , drainage , or increasing incisional pain .
The patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Vancomycin 750 mg intravenous q 18h.
2. Levofloxacin 500 mg po per day .
3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .
4. Captopril 100 mg po three times a day .

FOLLOWUP :
The patient was instructed that he needed to followup with Dr. Rhalt by calling his office for appointment at 763-6361 subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in Oaksale Lavalle .
The patient was also instructed to followup with Dr. Both of the Cardiology Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital following his discharge so that his antihypertension medications could be appropriately adjusted .
The patient will also be seen in followup by Dr. Chpo E. Enla General of the Plastic Surgery Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital so that his indwelling Jackson Pratt drains be appropriately management and if needed be discontinued by him .
The patient will also be followed by the Infectious Disease Service so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy .
The patient was instructed to followup with Dr. Naco Mesprhalt of the Infectious Disease Service by calling her office for an appointment at 094-902-2879 to be seen in approximately four weeks following the patient 's discharge .
Dr. Dau 's recommendation is that the patient is to stay on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from Pre Health on June 19 , 1998 to the Verg Medical Center Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
On May 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to Pre Health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung .
She was treated with Clindamycin and Erythromycin which were changed to Trovan and then transferred to A Hospital .
On May 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees .
Her oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to Pre Health Intensive Care Unit .
Chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion .
A VQ scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% .
On May 24 , 1998 , the patient had a CT scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions .
At this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ANA was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .
She was started on a steroid trial at that point .
Her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy .
On June 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed .
The patient was then started on 40 mg of Prednisone q. day .
From May 27 , 1998 through June 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 .
On June 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the Verg Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .

She recently retired as a clerical worker .
She denies any tobacco .
She has only social alcohol use .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Father died at age 56 of coronary artery disease .
Mother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma .
Brother has coronary artery disease .
There is no family history of hematologic problems .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , BUN 111 , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and LDH 496 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia :
The video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
The patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay .
This was changed to Solu-Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .
By discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .
The patient 's bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on July 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .
Repeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient 's pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .
At the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% .
2 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :
The patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , LDH of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear .
This was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on June 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through July 27 , 1999 .
She was also changed to intravenous Solu-Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to discharge .
Her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on July 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on July 20 , 1999 .
Her LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated .
She continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased .
The patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit .
Eventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after July 27 , 1999 .
After this , the patient 's platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge .
It is felt that the patient 's thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved .
She will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper .
3 ) Renal :
The patient presented in acute renal failure with a BUN of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 .
Throughout the month of June , she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12 , 1998 .
The opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .
She required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .
During the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation .
4 ) Infectious disease :
The patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on June 23 , 1998 , July 4 , 1998 , July 8 , 1998 and July 9 , 1998 .
The patient eventually had a left subclavian Tesio catheter placed and a right brachial PICC line placed on July 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected .
She received a full three week course of Vancomycin and also received a three week course of Ceftazidime .
In addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with Amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a Klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received Levofloxacin times fourteen days .
She also received a fourteen day course of Acyclovir which was begun on June 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus .
She was also on Fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days .
The patient was also started on Bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids .
5 ) Rheumatology :
The patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ANA of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .
Unfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange .
A repeat ANA , rheumatoid factor and ANCA may be repeated as an outpatient .
FOLLOW-UP :
1 ) The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr. Tamarg Study , in Arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation .
2 ) The patient is being discharged to A Hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on Monday , Wednesday and Friday .
The nephrologist who will follow her there is Dr. Study .
3 ) The patient will continue to have her CBC , LDH , bilirubin , chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm , the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 .
4 ) The patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula .
The left subclavian Tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time .
She would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at Pre Health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this .
5 ) The patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 .
6 ) The patient will continue her Prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month ( this was started on July 27 , 1999 ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by Pulmonary .
7 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment in the Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. Cedwi Stone at 336-2931 on August 30 , 1999 at 1:40 PM .
8 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment with Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm at the We Erthunt Hospital at 180-0455 on August 15 , 1999 at 12:30 PM .

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mayta Neek is a 69-year-old patient of Dr. Queszucenove Tadl at Cochusetts Medical Center .
He presents with increasing chest pain and shortness of breath .
He has a long history of coronary artery disease and has a two prior coronary bypass surgeries .
His first coronary bypass surgery was on 5/7/1985 by Dr. Riez .
He had LIMA to the LAD and vein graft to the diagonal and then a snake fashion two circumflexes and to the acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery .
He presented with angina and had an occluded LAD and severe circumflex and right coronary disease .
He had normal left ventricular function .
He did well , but had recurrent angina by 1999 and cardiac catheterization in March of 2000 showed normal left ventricular function with a native nondominant right coronary artery having a 95% stenosis and the vein graft to this vessel was occluded .
The left main was normal .
The LAD was also occluded .
The circumflex was patent , although there was disease of the obtuse marginal branches .
The LIMA to the LAD was patent , but there was downstream 70% lesions at the apical portion of the LAD .
The snake graft was open to the diagonal and to the first obtuse marginal branch , but was occluded to the second portion of this vessel .
For this reason , he had a second bypass operation on 5/5/2000 by Dr. Riez .
He had a vein graft to the acute marginal of the right coronary artery in snake fashion to the terminal portion of the right coronary artery .
He had a vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal one and a vein graft on the LAD bypassing the mid lesion .
The LIMA was left from the first surgery .
He did have transient atrial fibrillation after surgery .
He had chest pain and an abnormal stress test in 2001 and cardiac catheterization at that time on 8/28/2001 showed that all the grafts were patent , but the runoff to the first diagonal for the vein graft was compromised and he had a 2.5 x 15 mm S660 stent placed at the ostium of the diagonal branch .
He did have recurrent episodes of pain and his last stress test on 1/17/2005 showed that he could exercise for 9 minutes and then reached a peak heart rate of 99 on medication and a blood pressure of 150/100 , but he had shortness of breath and a posterolateral defect with some filling .
He therefore was referred for cardiac catheterization .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His past medical history includes hypertension , elevated cholesterol , and a herniated disc .
He also has had cataract repairs .
FAMILY HISTORY :
He has a strong family history with a father and an uncle having had coronary disease at a young age .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
His social history is that he lives in Lotyvall 1 , Quera , Minnesota with his wife Second .
He has four children .
He is present in a Capefrecam Luhthousy .
He does not drink and does not smoke .
ALLERGIES :
He is allergic to contrast dye having had hypotension and is premedicated with steroids .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On exam , he is 5 feet , 9 inches , and 160 pounds .
His blood pressure is 130/75 .
His pulse is 50 and regular .
His neck veins are not distended .
His head and neck exam is normal .
His lungs are clear .
His cardiac exam shows no murmurs or gallops .
His abdomen is benign .
His peripheral pulses are intact .
His neurologic exam was nonfocal .
He is fully oriented .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Includes an electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block .
Hematocrit 43% , potassium 4.3 , and creatinine of 1.0 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the cardiac cath laboratory .
There , the native right coronary artery was occluded and the vein graft to the RV marginal and the right-sided PDA was patent .
The LAD was occluded and the LIMA to the proximal LAD was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the LAD and that was also patent .
The vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent .
The culprit territory was the distal left-sided PDA coming off the circumflex and this had an 85% stenosis .
This was a very small vessel and this was a tortuous segment and a long lesion .
It was felt that this single lesion given the open distal right territory was not worth stenting and it was felt that he should be managed medically .
Left ventriculography showed inferior hypokinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular function .
He tolerated the procedure well .
He was monitored for the day .
He ambulated without difficulty .
He was discharged home and will be followed closely by his physicians at Sko Gerb Timp Valley Health and at Middso Memorial Hospital 's .
He will remain on beta blockers , ACE inhibitors , statins , aspirin and Plavix indefinitely .

Her gynecological history is notable for endometriosis and Ms. Straight is status post total abdominal hysterectomy in 2002 .
Her CA-125 preoperatively was 23 .
Ms. Straight was consented for diagnostic laparoscopy , excision of pelvic mass , and possible removal of right ovary .
Operative risks were reviewed with the patient per Dr. Eak including the risks of conversion to laparotomy .
She had a preoperative bowel prep .
PAST GYN HISTORY :
Endometriosis , status post total abdominal hysterectomy in 2002 for fibroids .
PAST OB HISTORY :
G2 , P2 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
History of functional heart murmur .

FAMILY HISTORY :
No family history of breast , colon or gynecological malignancies .
No family of history of cardiac disease , hypertension , and diabetes mellitus .
HOSPITALIZATION COURSE :
On July 27 , 2006 , Ms. Straight underwent pelviscopy that was converted to a laparotomy with right salpingo-oophorectomy , lysis of adhesions , right ileal resection with primary reanastomosis and appendectomy .
Please refer to operative report dictation for full details of the operative course .
Briefly , there is noted to be dense adhesions involving the ileum , the appendix , cecum , pelvic cystic mass and the right ovary .
In the course of lysis of adhesions a small enterotomy in ileum was noted .
General surgical consultation was obtained from Dr. Obe who performed lysis of ileal adhesions with another small enterotomy secondary to dense adhesions .
An approximately 3-4 cm segment of the ileum was resected with a primary end to end reanastomosis .
The estimated blood loss was 200 ml .
The final surgical pathology showed a right hemorrhagic cyst of undetermined origin with extensive adhesions , peri-appendiceal adhesions and ileum with adhesions .
Postoperatively , Ms. Straight was maintained with an NG tube and bowel rest until postoperative day #5 when she passed flatus .
Of note , on postoperative day #3 and #4 , she spiked isolated temperatures to 101 .
Evaluation was unrevealing in terms of focal source of her fever .
The urine and blood cultures were negative .
Chest x-ray was negative .
After postoperative day #4 , she experienced no further episodes of fever .
Following her NG tube discontinuation on postoperative day #5 , she experienced three to four episodes of bilious emesis .
On examination , her abdomen was nondistended and she had normal bowel sounds .
A KUB confirmed no evidence of an ileus or obstruction .
She was managed conservatively and kept npo for one night and then her diet was advanced slowly .
By the evening of postoperative day #7 , she was tolerating full house diet and had two spontaneous bowel movements .
It was unclear her etiology of her emesis following NG tube removal although possibly secondary to a subclinical ileus .
It is also a possibility that she had gastroenteritis from her relative who had presented recently to the ED with similar course of low grade fevers , emesis that resolved in short course .
At time of discharge ( postoperative day #8 08/04/06 ) , she was tolerating a house diet .

GI bleed .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Stable .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient 's hospital course is as follows :
Patient is an 84-year-old male who was transferred from an outside hospital with a low hematocrit of 21 and with guaiac-positive stool .
The day prior to admission , he experienced dyspnea on exertion , and on the day of admission he collapsed and complained of substantial weakness .
He denied any melana , any hematemesis , nausea or vomiting .
He was taken to an outside hospital at the time at which time it was found that his hematocrit was 21 , blood pressure 90/60 , and his INR was 3.3 .
Of note , he is anti-coagulated for an artificial heart valve .
He was at that point given 1 unit of packed red blood cells .
On further questioning , the patient reported that he started to feel "" different "" several days ago with slowing and difficult ambulation progressing to complete inability to ambulate .
He was also short of breath with ambulation , but he does have baseline shortness of breath with exertion .
He denied any chest pain , dysuria , loss of consciousness , fevers , chills or any history of myocardial infarction .
Patient was last admitted to Padrugmoff Hospital with a hematocrit of 24.5 , and was asymptomatic prior to admission .
At that time , he had guaiac-positive and had a small bowel follow through which was negative .
He was transfused 4 units during that admission and discharged with a hematocrit of 34 on vitamin C and iron sulfate .
EXAM ON ARRIVAL IN THE LO HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM :
On arrival at the Lo Hospital Emergency Room :
He was found to have a temperature of 97.4 , heart rate 65 , pressure 107/52 , respiratory rate 22 and saturating 100% on 2 L of a nasal cannula .
General exam at the time was notable for pale mucous membranes , left lateral eye deviation , clear lungs , 2/6 holosystolic murmur , best heard at the apex , abdomen was mildly distended but was soft and nontender and his extremities were without edema and skin without any rashes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is as follows :
History of coronary artery disease with status post two-vessel CABG in 1986 , also he was treated for congestive heart failure , hypertension , aortic valve replacement , and mitral valve replacement with St. Jude 's valve in 09/2001 , atrial fibrillation , history of prior GI bleed requiring blood transfusions during which he also had a colonoscopy on 05/2003 which demonstrated no neoplasia and scattered diverticuli .
The patient also , following his first GI bleed , had an EEG done in 07/2003 which showed gastritis with oozing and evidence of a recent bleed .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS :
Included Lasix , Lopressor , Coumadin , Diovan , torsemide , Flomax , Protonix , Senekot , potassium , vitamin C , iron , and a multivitamin .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Notable for no tobacco , no alcohol .
He has a wife with Alzheimer 's who lives in a skilled-nursing facility .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a BUN and creatinine of 78 , 1.7 ; for a sodium , potassium 139 and 3.6 ; chloride and bicarb 108 , 21 .
White count 7 , hematocrit 24.2 , platelet count was 183 .
His INR was also 3.4 .
PTT was 55 .
His EKG was notable for right bundle branch block , left axis deviation , but was in sinus rhythm .
His UA had 10-17 white blood cells ; trace leukocyte esterase hyaline casts numbering 60-70 .
His chest x-ray was notable for clear lungs with no edema or infiltrates and small bilateral effusions .
OTHER NOTALBE LABS :
Patient was found to have a troponin of 0.71 on admission with a CK of 46 and CKMB of 3.4 .
ASSESSMENT :
At that time , it was felt that the patient was likely having a repeat GI bleed and while he was hemodynamically stable , he had evidently lost a substantial amount of blood .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. GI :
Patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight , the first night after admission and his hematocrit bumped up appropriately .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission .
He was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and on iron sulfate and vitamin C .
His Coumadin was held at the time given the bleeding , even though it was important to keep his INR 2.5-3.5 , given his artificial valve it was felt that the risk of continued bleeding was to great to continue the Coumadin .
He was subsequently seen by the GI team who performed an upper endoscopy which demonstrated the following :
In the esophagus , there was a small hiatal hernia and in the stomach there is evidence of erosive gastritis of the body of the stomach and the antrum , the mucous appeared edematous .
A small polyp was found in the fundus which stigmata of old bleeding ; an Endoclip was applied to this .
Another polyp was found in the antrum and cold biopsies were obtained there .
In the duodenum , a small AVM was noted in the second portion of the duodenum and was cauterized .
The biopsy subsequently demonstrated a hyperplastic polyp with acute and chronic inflammation and erosion and reactive epithelial changes but no dysplasia .
Also of note , prior to the upper endoscopy , the patient received fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation .
Patient remained hemodynamically stable during and after the upper endoscopy and his hematocrit remained above 30 following this until the point of discharge .
His last recorded hematocrit on discharge was 31.3 .
His last BUN and creatinine were 42 and 1.5 with an INR of 2.5 .
Consideration was given to performing a repeat colonoscopy .
This was discussed with the GI Service who felt that this was not necessary given the recent colonoscopy that he had had in 05/2003 .
2. Cardiovascular :
A :
Ischemia :
Patient 's troponin bump was found to be likely to demand ischemia in the setting of his GI bleed , it was not felt that he was having acute coronary syndrome .
On discharge , he was continued on his aspirin , simvastatin and his Lopressor which was initially held , and subsequently restarted .
B :
Rhythm :
Patient continued to be in A-fib. throughout the admission and was restarted on his Coumadin concurrently with heparin .
Heparin was subsequently DCd once his INR reached a therapeutic level between 2.5-3.5 .
His last reported INR on discharge was 2.5 .
C :
Valves :
Patient had , as noted above , his anticoagulation was initially reversed despite his having artificial valves .
However , his Coumadin was subsequently restarted and he achieved therapeutic INR levels before discharge .
D :
Pump :
Patient , during this hospital course , became hypervolemic likely due to his diuretics being held and due to his receiving blood products .
He was diuresed initially with one dose of Lasix and subsequently with one dose of torsemide after it was discovered that he developed thrombocytopenia on a prior admission in reaction to Lasix .
He subsequently was diuresed to a euvolemic state .
Of note , he did not become thrombocytopenic on this admission .
DISPOSITION :
Was discharged on 11/16/2003 in stable condition with the last recorded hematocrit of 31.3 .
He was asked to continue on his Nexium , iron and vitamin C and was continued on his other home medications .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
His final medications on discharge were as follows :
Aspirin 325 , he was restarted on a PPI , also on iron , vitamin C , Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d .
Of note , this was at a decreased dose compared to that which he came in on , Coumadin 7.5 , mg , torsemide 100 q.d. , sucralfate , simvastatin , Diovan .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
He was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up with his PCP as well as to follow up with the Anticoagulation Clinic and Dr. Gilbert .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
Given the localization of the hematoma and the history of hypertension , the most likely cause for Mrs. Dua 's cerebellar hemorrhage is hypertension .
A magnetic resonance imaging study will be scheduled as an outpatient in three months to rule out a small vascular malformation if responsible for the hemorrhage .
At the time of discharge , Mrs. Dua has had a remarkable recovery .
She is now able to walk fitfully and use her left hand with no problem .
The exam is remarkable for a mild leftsided face , arm and leg weakness and sensory deficit that should further improve with physical therapy and occupational therapy help .
She will be followed by the OT / PT dept. for that .
Her hypertension was difficult to manage initially and required three days of Intensive Care Unit with A-line and Nipride intravenously .
It was finally under control with high doses of Captopril , Nifedipine , and hydrochlorothiazide .
The workup to rule out secondary cause of hypertension given the patient 's young age and the difficulty controlling the blood pressure was started as an inpatient and will be completed by Dr. ______________as an outpatient .
So far no secondary causes of hypertension were identified but causes like lymphocytic ? chromocytoma or renal artery stenosis have not been ruled out yet .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of poorly controlled diabetes , status post multiple admissions for HHNK , and recent right arm fracture .
Patient initially presented four days ago to the emergency room .
At that time , she was febrile , with no obvious source of infection .
She was sent home with pain control .
Cultures were pending .
Over the past days before admission , the patient had been complaining of increased arm pain .
Of note , the patient states that her pain is so bad that she was not taking her insulin .
On the morning of admission , the son could not reach her by phone .
He was concerned .
LRAH then called to say that they found her in the house very confused , called EMS , and she was brought into the hospital .
Per the son , patient not complaining of any other problems ; no chest pain , no shortness of breath , no upper respiratory symptoms , no cough , no dysuria , and no abdominal pain .
Of note , blood cultures from Christmas Eve grew MSSA in the blood .
In the emergency room , she was given 6 units subcu , with no resolve , then insulin drip at 6 units per hour , then increased to 10 including with IV hydration , and she was started on nafcillin for MSSA .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Cirrhosis , hep C , diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , hypertension , neuropathy , right arm fracture , status post fall , CAD , with a stress echo 12/1 which showed reversible ischemia and an EF of 60% .
Her medications on admission included Lasix 80 , Norvasc 2.5 , Lopressor 50 b.i.d. , lisinopril 40 q. day , Risperdal one q. day , Humulin 70/30 40 U in the morning and 25 U in the evening , regular insulin scale , carbamazepine 100 , and Neurontin .
She has no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone .
She walks with a cane , has LRAH care , no tobacco , no alcohol , no drug use .
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION :
She was afebrile at 97.6 , heart rate 102 , respirations 20 , blood pressure 192/92 .
In general , she was an obese African American woman in no acute distress , mumbling .
HEENT :
Pupils equal and reactive , her oropharynx was moist with no lesions .
Cardiovascularly , she was tachycardic , normal S1 and S2 , regular , no murmurs .
JVP was flat .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Abdomen was obese , soft , non-tender , no masses , no rebound , and no guarding .
EXTREMITIES :
She had swelling in the right arm , very , very minimal .
Her right arm was on a sling .
In her lower extremities , she had bilateral edema to the knees , 2+.
NEURO :
She was oriented to person only , intermittently following commands .
Labs were notable for blood cultures positive for MSSA .
Chest x-ray was pending at the time of admission .
Head CT was negative .
EKG showed normal sinus , no ST changes .
Her labs were notable on admission for a sodium of 129 , creatinine of 2.0 , hematocrit of 34 , albumin was 2.5 .
She had a gap of 14 .
Her ABG was 7.40 , 47 , 90 .
Her CKs and troponins were negative .
Her beta hydroxybutyrate was 0.36 .
Her UA showed 3+ protein , 5-8 WBCs , 8-10 RBCs , and 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
This is a 55-year-old with a history of uncontrolled diabetes in the past , who presents with HHNK .
At the time , she was treated for such , including IV fluids and an insulin drip .
She recovered very nicely .
Continued hospital course , she recovered well from her HHNK .
Ortho-wise , emergent ortho consult decided that the right shoulder needed to be drained .
Tap showed that she had an active infection , with 464000 WBCs , 198000 RBCs , including 88% polys , from the right shoulder .
Therefore , she was thought to have right shoulder sepsis and was taken to the OR emergently .
In the operating room , 40-50 cc of pus was drained from the shoulder and a drain was placed .
She received IV fluids and had an estimated blood loss of 1200 cc .
The patient 's crit dropped from a baseline of 32 to 19 .
She was also not following commands and her glucose was 876 .
She was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit on 12/30/02 , the patient was recovering , with being able to follow commands .
She stayed in the Intensive Care Unit until 1/5/03 .
She was treated with nafcillin and gentamicin , also with vancomycin .
Cultures still showed MSSA .
Hospital course during the MICU stay was notable for a decreased hematocrit .
She received multiple units of blood for this .
Also , she had decreased urine output , thought to be prerenal , and received large volume IV fluids .
She required small doses , a renal dose of dopa , to increase her urine output , and she did better .
She responded well and then the dopa was D / c'd on 1/4/03 .
From the ID perspective , the patient had a TTE on 12/30 that showed an EF of 65% , question of a mobile echodensity along the RV , but no proof of endocarditis .
This was significant in that the head CT done on 1/4/03 to evaluate change in mental status revealed a new right parietal infarct that may represent septic emboli ; however , on further evaluation it was thought that this was most likely a stroke , not really just sepsis .
There was no recommendation for further workup .
She was transferred to the floor on 1/5/03 , and by system :
1. ID :
She was continued to be treated for MSSA bacteremia and she should complete a 6 weeks course .
2. RENAL :
Patient slowly improved with her creatinine on the day of admission , still continuing to improve .
Secondary to all the IV fluids she received in the Intensive Care Unit , the patient has been having a goal of -1 L / day , which we have been able to accomplish successfully on Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , with extra doses of 80 mg IV as needed .
3. Cardiovascularly , patient , of note , had an EKG that had intermittent right bundle-branch block ; however , this recovered .
She does have known CAD from previous echos .
She has been stable .
She is on a beta blocker .
Her ACE inhibitor had been held , but may be restarted as soon as her creatinine normalizes .
4. NEUROLOGICAL :
Her head CT showed a right parietal infarct .
Patient should have an MRI as an outpatient to follow up .
Most likely represents an ischemic stroke .
Workup for B12 and RPR studies were all negative .
5. GI-wise , the patient had been started on tube feeds ; however , she recovered and NG tube was D / c'd and patient taking p.o.'s .
She was also started on lactulose to increase her bowel movements as needed .
Her ammonia level is normalized .
6. Heme-wise , her hematocrit remained stable .
7. Endocrine-wise , her sugars have been much improved and she continues on her NPH dose .
Plan for the long term is that the patient will receive six weeks of IV antibiotics .
She will return to see Dr. Ayan Koteskismanhout in orthopaedic surgery in 10-12 weeks for evaluation of the right shoulder and aspiration .
If the aspirate is negative and overall health is good , then she will consider implantation of hemiarthroscopy ; for now , she needs to continue in the sling .
For access , the patient will have a PICC line in order to continue IV fluids .
The discharge medications include albuterol nebulizer 2.5 q. 2 h. as needed , calcium carbonate 1250 b.i.d. , carbamazepine 100 p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 120 p.o. q. day , insulin sliding scale , lactulose 15-30 mL p.o. q.i.d. as needed .
She will also be discharged on insulin 70/30 52 U in the morning 30 U in the evening , M.V.I. therapeutic , Neurontin 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nafcillin 2 g IV q. 4 h. , Risperdal 1 mg p.o. q. day , Nexium 20 mg p.o. q. day , Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q. 4 h. , oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q. 6-8 h. p.r.n. , Atrovent nebulizer .5 mg q.i.d. , and she should restart an ACE inhibitor , lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day .

He went to Padrugmoff Hospital Emergency Room .
He has a history of hypertension , diabetes , and high cholesterol .
In 2003 , he had a non ST elevation MI , came to the RWH , and had a cath done , which showed a 40% RCA , which was hazy .
An IVUS was done , and it was felt that it was more severe .
He underwent a PTC stenting of an RCA with a Vision stent , 3 x 18 .
Diagonal 1 also had a 99% stenosis .
There was no other noted disease .
Since then , the patient has occasional chest pain with emotional stress , when he is angry or upset .
Yesterday morning , he developed intermittent substernal chest pain with radiation to the left shoulder that worsened with any activity and any motion of his shoulders .
It progressed over the course of the day requiring less movement .
He also became short of breath with climbing a flight of stairs .
He denies diaphoresis or nausea .
He went to the Padrugmoff Hospital Emergency Room after trying nitroglycerin at home .
However , his nitroglycerin was old and the script was expired .
In the ER , he received 3 sublingual nitroglycerins and 1 mg of Dilaudid .
After that , he was pain-free .
Lopressor IV was given to control his heart rate .
He also received Lipitor 80 mg , Plavix 300 , heparin IV , integrelin double bolus , followed by a drip .

That test was negative .
He underwent lower extremity study to rule out a DVT in both legs .
That was negative .
He was noted to have an episode of desaturation into the 80% range while sleeping .
Pulmonary consult was done , and it was felt that the patient should undergo a formal sleep study , full PFTs , and a repeat CT scan in 1 year to assess for pulmonary nodule that was seen .
However , please note that this nodule has been stable over time .
The patient also complained of intermittent right neck swelling , and recommendations are to consider a CT scan with contrast to evaluate nodes in his neck .
On physical exam today , the patient did not have any swelling , and he states that he did not feel the swelling was present .
The patient underwent an adenosine stress test , where he exercised for 4 minutes , reaching 65% of predicted heart rate .
He did not have chest pain .
EKG was negative for ischemia .
The myocardial perfusion images show no definite evidence of ischemia .
